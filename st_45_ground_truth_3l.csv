We would argue that this positive correlation is only true if the increase in oxygen consumption was secondary to a higher tissue pO2 or an increase in the number of sites.	2
Whose mutations occur so frequently as to prompt speculation that disabling “the RB pathway” may be essential for the formation of cancer cells.	3
However, this was not sufficient for full blown transformation of primary human cells, which also required the collaborative inhibition of pRb, together with the expression of hTERT, RASV12.	1
Hence, the extent to which miRNAs were capable of specifically regulating metastasis has remained unresolved.	1
Therefore, it is unlikely that the localization of Aurora-A in the nucleus as determined by these two antibodies is as a result of cross-reaction of anti-Aurora-A antibodies.	3
However, the possibility seems unlikely because we have also observed that the human lung cancer cell line, H460, displays similar growth inhibition when it is transduced by MIGR1-Lats2 retrovirus, while expression of Lats1 in H460 resulted in a G2/M block and induced apoptosis.	2
This theory postulates that cancers arise in stem cells or early committed progenitors due to their inability to differentiate in a regulated fashion. 	2
Thus, miR-31 may represent a marker for metastasis in a variety of breast cancer subtypes; however, its utility as a prognostic indicator will depend on extension of these initial observations.	3
This conjecture is also supported by observations in mice that are heterozygous for mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (Sod2+/−).	2
We hypothesize that these 32 genes represent potential core components of the necroptotic pathway.	3
We suggest that suppression of LATS2 is an important factor.	2
Finally, we have identified 26 direct Oct4 transcriptional targets which may represent candidate regulatory nodes by which cell fate decisions could be directed to facilitate the use of hESCs in therapeutic and regenerative medicine.	3
We propose that these six capabilities are shared in common by most and perhaps all types of human tumors.	2
We therefore hypothesized that conserved regions in mRNAs may serve as docking platforms for modulators of miRNA activity.	3
The role of telomerase in immortalizing cells can be demonstrated directly by ectopically expressing the enzyme in cells, where it can convey unlimited replicative potential onto a variety of normal early passage, presenescent cells in vitro.	1
Most miRNAs may act as direct suppressor-miRs or post-transcriptional repressors of known oncogenes.1	3
The two major sites for ROS generation are believed to be at sites I and III where large changes in the potential energy of the electrons, relative to the reduction of oxygen, occur. 	2
Our results can be explained by the idea that elements needed for Drosha recognition reside within the sequences that flank the miR-223 predicted hairpin.	2
The observation that the differentiation of myeloid and other lymphoid cell types was not totally blocked when the B-lymphoid lineage increased suggests that miR-181, at least when considered singly rather than in combination with other miRNAs, appears to function more as a lineage modulator than as a switch. 	1
These data suggest that PTPN12 is inactivated, in part, via deletion in a wide range of cancers and support the hypothesis that PTPN12 is a frequently inactivated tumor suppressor.	2
We suspect that growth signaling pathways suffer deregulation in all human tumors.	3
It became apparent that the pRb and p53 pathways are involved in this process.	2
It is probable that mouse Lats2 also regulates the G1/S transition through down-regulation of Cyclin E/Cdk2 kinase activity in NIH3T3 cells.	2
We believe that the trigger for this response isthe persistence of DNA damage in cells that can poorly repair it.	3
Here we present evidence that INPP4B functions as a tumor suppressor.	1
It has been proposed that an unique miRNA expression profile for a particular cancer would be a useful biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.	2
We confirmed the consistency of miRNA expression driven by miR-Vec by cloning eight miR-Vec plasmids expressing randomly chosen miRNAs.	1
In accordance with these observations, our data show the requirement of high RAS oncoproteins overexpression to achieve the loss of the differentiated phenotype, at least 10-fold over the endogenous wild-type RAS.	1
Consequently miRNAs have been demonstrated to act either as oncogenes or tumor suppressors.	1
Recently, it has been recognized that animal and plant genomes contain an abundance of small regulatory RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides (nts) in length.	1
We reasoned that the coactivation of these two pathways might replace H-RASV12 in transformation.	2
Many malignancies considered to be non-TK driven because of the absence of a dominant TK mutation may indeed be dependent on TK signaling.	3
Another study suggested that overexpression of miR-17-5p, miR-20a, miR-21, miR-92, miR-106a, and miR-155 could be considered an miRNA signature of solid cancer.	2
Data suggest that both miR-143 and miR-145 probably need to be downregulated in cervical cells for tumor progression.	2
Inactivation of only p53 gave rise to inefficient tumor growth in some of the mice (2 out of 6), most likely due to increased genomic instability in the absence of p53 while propagating the cells before the injections. 	2
It is possible that the activation of Bmf may induce either apoptosis or necroptosis in a stimulus and cellular context-dependent manner.	3
These findings suggest that IKBKE is a key target of the 1q32 amplification in breast cancer cell lines and tumors.	2
The validity of this method for the identification of genes related to stem cell identity is assured by the presence of genes which have previously defined roles in ESCs.	1
Presumably act by pairing to the mRNAs of their target genes to direct gene silencing processes critical for hematopoiesis.	2
Experimental manipulations that increase the redox potential of site I or site III generally increase the rate of ROS generation.	2
These observations strongly support the conclusion that amplifications of IKBKE play an important role in the pathogenesis of a subset of breast tumors and identify IKKE as promising cancer target.	1
Most studies clearly demonstrate centrosomal localization of both LATS1 and LATS2 during interphase14,22,27,29-33 and association with the mitotic apparatus in mitotic cells.	1
The emerging role of miRNAs in the regulation of fundamental set of cellular mechanisms such as proliferation, apoptosis, development, differentiation and metabolism clearly suggests that any aberration in miRNA biogenesis pathway or its activity contributes to the human disease pathogenesis including cancer .	1
We speculate that this segment nucleates pairing between miRNAs and mRNAs.	3
it is unlikely that p14ARF has an essential protective role against RAS-induced oncogenic transformation, in contrast to what has been found in mice.	3
