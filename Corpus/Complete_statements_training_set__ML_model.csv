Therefore, the discovery that ASPP1 and ASPP2 cooperate with RAS to enhance p53-induced apoptosis suggests that loss of ASPP1 or ASPP2 expression may be a frequent event in human cancers with mutant RAS.	3
Here, we confirmed that PKA could phosphorylate serine 83 on p85 and that serine 83 phosphorylation contributes to 14-3-3ζ-mediated transformation of cancer cells.	1
Because HER2 promotes the interaction of the SHP2 tyrosine phosphatase, the known positive effector of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, including EGFR and HER2, one may also argue that HER2 suppresses autophosphorylation on the c-Cbl and Grb2 binding sites indirectly by facilitating SHP2-mediated dephosphorylation.	3

AKAP-Lbc is also implicated in cardiac hypertrophic signaling, and we have shown that AKAP-Lbc-tethered PKA is important for the induction of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy ( ).	1
In support of our findings, a recent study showed that P-REX1 knock-down reduces Rac1/Pak/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling [ ].	1
To confirm that the effects we measured were due to depletion of Pak rather than off-target effects of the siRNAs, we generated MDCK II cells with dox-inducible expression of active (L106F) Pak2-CFP with mutations rendering it resistant to Pak2#1 siRNA ( ).	1
The rapid phosphorylation of T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule on tyrosine residues suggested that a membrane-proximal tyrosine kinase is responsible for its phosphorylation after T Cell Receptor stimulation.	2
Of note is the fact that CARP-1 functional mimetic-4-dependent down-regulation of p21Rac1 in our array experiment is supportive of our WB data in where both the CARP-1 functional mimetic-4 and CARP-1 functional mimetic-5 treatments attenuated levels of p21Rac1 in Daoy cells.	2
Here, we show that B cell antigen receptor-associated tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk synergistically phosphorylate HS1, and that Tyr378 and Tyr-397 of HS1 are the critical residues for its B cell antigen receptor-induced phosphorylation.	1
Fig. , A and B, demonstrates that under these experimental conditions, T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule becomes tyrosine phosphorylated by lck and fyn but not by ZAP70.	1

In this study, we demonstrated that upregulation of Gab2 expression induced the conversion of polarized epithelial cells to spindle-shaped, fibroblast-like mesenchymal cells with decreased cell-cell contact, enhanced invasion and migration in colorectal cancer cells, upregulated vimentin, MMP7 and MMP9 and downregulated E-cadherin.	1
Elk-1 also recruits ERK to the promoters of its target genes, suggesting that ERK phosphorylates additional substrates in transcription complexes at mitogen-responsive promoters.	2
In addition, such a functional link suggests that PRL-3 and Src may cooperate in colon carcinoma, in which the expression of PRL-3 as well as the expression and activity of Src , all increase with advancing disease.	3
Surprisingly, the K197E mutation also completely disrupted membrane association, suggesting that this residue, which is not conserved among phosphoinositide-binding pleckstrin homology domains, has a critical role in phosphoinositide binding of the Bam32 pleckstrin homology domain.	2
In summary, our study demonstrates that Gab2 could induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and promote colorectal cancer cell metastasis through the MEK/ERK/MMP signaling.	1
We provide evidence that KRas translocation occurs through sequestration of the polybasic-prenyl motif by Ca2+/calmodulin and subsequent release of KRas from the plasma membrane, in a process reminiscent of GDP dissociation inhibitor-mediated membrane recycling of Rab and Rho GTPases.	1
Cumulatively, these data highlight the presence of major Rho-related signaling processes in the nucleus of cells, an area that has previously been neglected.	1
We found that sorafenib reduced ERK phosphorylation in RasV12 cells at all concentrations examined.	1
Intriguingly, knockdown of ARNT does not effect 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-mediated repression of estrogen-regulated transcription, suggesting that AHR represses estrogen receptor function independently of ARNT.	2
Since Cas has a Src-binding domain, one possibility is that the Src kinase substitutes for the FAK kinase in phosphorylating Cas in cells expressing FRNK, thereby generating binding sites for Crk.	2
Our study indicates that cells employ multiple and possibly mutually exclusive mechanisms to activate AKT ( ).	1
These results suggest that TAS-116 markedly inhibits p-C-Raf, p-MEK1/2, and p-ERK, which were paradoxically activated by these inhibitors.	2
The analysis of Forkhead box O-regulated genes in our data set revealed the cell cycle as the most significantly affected biological process by ETP-45658 treatment, strongly supporting the hypothesis that after the treatment with ETP-45658 (or PI-103) cell cycle arrest is likely to be mediated by the action of Forkhead box O proteins.	1
The identification of novel proteins that are involved in MAPK or AKT/mTOR signaling and differentially expressed between normal and cancer cells will provide mechanistically distinct therapeutic targets with the potential to inhibit these key cancer-associated pathways.	2

We did not observe translocation of YFP-CaM to the plasma membrane in neurons cotransfected with CFP (unpublished data) or CFP-HRas-tail ( c; Fig. S4), indicating that YFP-CaM translocation to the plasma membrane is KRas-tail dependent.	1
Consistent with this hypothesis, we measured the relative levels of expression of exogenous and native CaM, using an anti-CaM antibody, and found that exogenously introduced CaM only increases overall CaM levels by ∼15% (Fig. S5).	2
Inhibition of PRL-1 expression has been shown to reduce expression of both Src and the important Src substrate, p130Cas , suggesting that PRL-1 transcriptionally activates key components of Src signaling pathways, and may promote both normal and aberrant Src-dependent phenotypes.	3
These results indicate that danusertib-induced autophagy in AGS and NCI-N78 cells is, at least in part, ascribed to inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.	1
Several lines of evidence indicate that Akt plays a positive role in Wnt-β-catenin signaling, most likely through phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK3, although its precise mechanism of action remains largely debatable ( ).	2

Taken together, these results demonstrate that Gab1 is required for EGF-stimulation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and Akt.	1
In this study, we found that PLX4032 at 2.5 μM strongly increased ERK phosphorylation, but weakly elevated Death receptor 5 levels in HCT116 in contrast to its strong effects on both ERK activation and Death receptor 5 upregulation at 5 uM. 	1
This study indicates that early life exposure to arsenic during a critical stage in development may have resulted in aberrant genetic reprogramming that leads to events associated with hepatocarcinogenesis later in life.	3

Considering LY294002, GDC-0941 or Rapamycin can reduce Gab2-enhanced cell migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells, drugs that target the PI3K/mTOR pathway can be potentially used to treat Gab2-overexpressed ovarian cancer in combination with standard chemotherapy.	2
The selected sequences were submitted to a BLAST search against the human genome sequence to ensure that only p160ROCK gene of the human genome was targeted. 21-21-nucleotide RNAs were purchased from Dharmacon in deprotected and desalted form.	1
The above data indicate that, as a consequence of activation of receptor tyrosine kinases, the Sos-1-Grb2 complex is disrupted, whereas the Sos-1-E3b1-Eps8 complex persists in the cell.	1
Using an antibody that recognizes the dually phosphorylated, active forms of ERK1/2 (p42/p44), we demonstrated that ephrinB2/Fc induced a strong activation of ERK1/2 of 60- and 10-min duration for P19 and CHO-EphB1 cells, respectively ( C).	1
In order to test this hypothesis, retroviral vectors were used to introduce either the Gab1 or ErbB3 genes into Gab1 -/- MEFs that endogenously express the EGFR but not ErbB3, and pools of stable cell lines were selected for further analysis.	2
Analysis of cells expressing E-cadherin mutant constructs indicated that p120 is required for the E-cadherin-mediated transition from weak to strong adhesion.	1
Unlike the canonical Ras/Raf/Erk pathway and data previously describing Erk activation by TGF-β , our study showed c-Raf activation appears to occur primarily through Pak2, similar to that described for erythropoietin and platelet derived growth factor , , and mimicing its budding yeast homologue, Ste20, by acting as a MAP4K .	1
We placed these changes into a biological framework reporting here that the most significantly affected biological response by ETP-45658 (and PI-103) was the cell cycle and cell cycle-related processes.	2
Also in agreement with our results, Bright et al. [ ] reported that neither BRSK1 nor BRSK2 was activated in CCL13 cells overexpressing CaMKKβ, while Uboha et al. [ ] reported that CaMKK partially purified from mouse cortex (isoform not specified) failed to phosphorylate MARK2 in cell-free assays.	1

sphingosine 1-phosphate induced an immediate and sustained increase in transendothelial monolayer electrical resistance that was significantly inhibited in c-Abl-silenced EC.	2
Together with the data shown in , these results confirm that PRL-3 promotes both invasion and motility, and that tyrosine 53 is crucial to both phenotypes, presumably due to a requirement for the phosphorylation event that occurs at this site.	1
After 2 hours of incubation, the wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline to remove cells that failed to adhere to the bottom, and cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes.	1
In contrast, Mcl1 expression was unaltered, suggesting that this reduction was unlikely to result from a pleiotropic defect to Mediator.	2
The migratory activity of the transfected cells was compared to that of Calu1 cells that had been transiently transfected with empty pCEP plasmids (tCalu1-mock).	1

A previous study has demonstrated that Rac1 activity corresponds with angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma .	1

Thus, we speculated that TDRG1 contributes to the occurrence and/or development of testicular seminoma.	3
The previous experiments implicate E-cadherin in the direct recruitment of p120 to junctions, but do not rule out the possibility of a secondary association of p120 with other junctional proteins that might accumulate in cadherin-induced cell-cell contacts.	2
These results support the notion that SHP2 inhibition on proliferative signalling depends, at least in part, on the regulation of Ras phosphorylation status.	2
Based on the data shown in , smad 3 linker region is similarly phosphorylated by Erk, in that U0126 has the same effect on inhibiting the decay of C-terminal phosphorylated smads 2 and 3.	1
In addition, it clarifies and defines a role of Erk activation in modulating smad signaling and the consequences of the cross-talk between the two signaling pathways, suggesting that the concept of smad-dependent and smad-independent signaling pathways may be inappropriate.	3

A previous phosphoproteomic study suggested that Y1222//Y1222 in HER2 may mediate Shc binding ( ), but our results demonstrate very low binding of Shc proteins regardless of enhanced HER2 phosporylation on Y1221/1222.	3
Strikingly, in HUVEC transfected with EGFP-Rac1-Y64D that mimics a constitutively phosphorylated tyrosine at position 64, the mean surface area decreased markedly.	1
These results suggest that STRADα is normally complexed with LKB1 in the cell, and that STRAD is unstable in the absence of LKB1.	2
TAK165 further enhanced the all-trans retinoic acid-triggered transcription of RARB and PXN ( ), indicating that the activation of RARα is involved in the TAK165 and all-trans retinoic acid induced differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells.	1
Blotting of the three AMP-activated protein kinase kinase preparations using anti-LKB1, anti-STRADα and anti-mouse protein 25-α antibodies (Figure ) showed that activation of the heterotrimers was not simply proportional to the amount of these polypeptides in the preparation.	1
They therefore proposed that CaMKKβ could replace the γ subunit within the AMPK complex.	2
In this work we aim to unravel the interplay between 20 proteins that were previously associated with EGFR signaling and erlotinib drug sensitivity.	1
The existence of Sos-1 in two physically and functionally distinct pools suggests the hypothesis that its presence in a Sos-1-Grb2 or a Sos-1-E3b1-Eps8 complex could dictate its Ras- or Rac-specific GEF activities, respectively.	2
Furthermore, two biochemical studies have reported that Ca2+/calmodulin binds to KRas (but not HRas) ( ; ) and dissociates KRas from membranes ( ), although it is not clear from these studies whether CaM interacts with the membrane-anchoring motif or other regions of the small GTPase.	1
We demonstrated that PP2Ac co-precipitated with NDRG2 in the lysates of crosslinked HUT102/NDRG2 cells ( ).	1

In the wild-type apo p110α/p85α-inter-SH2 domain structure, helix kα11 is complete to residue 1048, and the rest of the C-terminal sequence is largely disordered ( ) [hereafter all p110 secondary structure nomenclature is according to that of p110γ ( )].	1
ATP-dependent uptake of 14C-doxorubicin was determined by subtracting the radio-activity (cpm) of the controls without ATP from that of the experimental groups containing ATP (panel A).	1
These results suggest that β-catenin, Chibby, and 14-3-3 form a complex, and that the interaction between Chibby and 14-3-3 is crucial for stable ternary complex formation.	2
Although the regulation of p27 could in some settings occurs at transcriptional level - , it is widely accepted that in human tumors its expression levels are mainly regulated by post-transcriptional modifications .	2
It has been well documented that one of the main mediators of hypoxia in cells is reactive oxygen species production , , and recent work has shown that reactive oxygen species could regulate ovarian tumor angiogenesis and growth .	1

We found various markers of senescence when we knocked down SHP2 expression in Glioblastoma multiforme cell lines, suggesting that SHP2 protects the cells from senescence.	2
We found that danusertib induces cell cycle arrest and promotes cell apoptosis and autophagy, with involvement of signaling pathways mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and AMPK in AGS and NCI-N78 cell lines.	1
Synaptojanin 2 (SYNJ2) is a phosphatidylinositol phosphatase that controls two distinct functions, clathrin-mediated endocytosis and tumor cell invadopodia formation and invasion.	1
Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose and were blotted using antibodies that recognized specific domains of proteins, or hemagglutinin or Myc tags.	1
A potential explanation for this is that HeLa cells do not express LKB1 ([ ]; see also above).	1
Whereas pervanadate caused accumulation of phospho-PRL-3 in the presence of vehicle only, SU6656 inhibited PRL-3 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, such that 1 µM inhibited phosphorylation by ∼20% and no phospho-PRL-3 was detected in the presence of 10 µM of this Src family kinase inhibitor ( ).	1
Vice versa the threonine 198E/D substitutions that mimic the phosphorylation event, did not confer any increased stability to p27 protein both in vitro and in vivo.	1
One recent report demonstrated that the combination of AZD6244 and the AKT inhibitor MK2206 is tolerable in a phase I trial [ ].	1
As has been previously described, PTEN G129E was also able to inhibit glioblastoma cell migration ( ; ), but interesting, this ability was shared by PTEN Y138L, suggesting that either lipid or protein phosphatase activity are sufficient to mediate a similar effect on cell migration in this assay ( ).	2
The lack of detectable basal tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of pervanadate suggests that this phosphorylation event is transient, evident only when the cellular phosphatase(s) responsible for dephosphorylation are blocked.	2
However, our unpublised data demonstrates significant tyrosine phosphorylation of AKT2 upon coexpression of Ack1 and AKT2 in HEK293T cells, suggesting that both AKT1 and 2 are Ack1 substrates.	1
Paradoxically, increasing numbers of studies have also shown that RAS activation induces apoptosis.	1
AMP-activated protein kinase kinase activity and Thr172 phosphorylation, as well as detectable STRADα and mouse protein 25-α subunits, were recovered following immunoprecipitation of LKB1 from a line of HeLa cells that stably express wild-type LKB1 [ ] (lane 5).	1
As MED23 co-immunoprecipitates efficiently with MED14 and CDK8 (see e.g. Supplementary Figure S2c), we reasoned that an indirect interaction between Elk-1 and MED14 might also be detectable.	2
As expected, all agents also increased the phosphorylation of ACC1 at Ser79//S79 and AMPK at Thr172 in MEFs (mouse embryonic fibroblasts), although the effect of A769662 on Thr172 phosphorylation was small, indicating that it was mainly acting through an allosteric mechanism (Supplementary Figure S2B).	2
In this study, we found that PAK4 (p21-activated kinase 4) expression and activity were elevated in gastric cancer cells with acquired CDDP resistance (AGS/CDDP and MKN-45/CDDP) compared with their parental cells.	1
Notably, the recruitment of p85 to Abi1 was independent of receptor tyrosine kinase activation (unpublished data), in agreement with the observation that Abi1 displays constitutive levels of tyrosine phosphorylation (unpublished data).	1
The cells were fed with growth medium containing 0.3% soft agar twice, and after that, feeding was by replenishing Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.	1
Furthermore, the distinct inhibitor sensitivity of various EGFR mutants argues that therapies may need to be targeted against specific mutant forms of a protein, whereas generalized inhibition of a particular oncogenic target may not be sufficient.	3

It has been recognized that control of cell cycle progression in cancer cells is an effective strategy to inhibit tumor growth ( , ).	1
Together, these results support the notion that Ca2+/calmodulin sequesters the polybasic-prenyl motif of KRas and Rap1a and extracts these small GTPases from the plasma membrane.	2
To analyze association of c-Src with VEGFR-2 we utilized the previously characterized VEGFR-2 chimera herein called CKR which is created by replacing the extracellular domain of VEGFR-2 with that of human Colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) and expressed in PAE (porcine aortic endothelial) cells as an experimental system.	1
These data indicate that Gab2 expression activates the PI3K pathway that contributes to the inhibition of E-cadherin in ovarian cancer cells.	1
Our recent study demonstrated that Klf5 loss in Pten-null prostate tumors also activates PI3K/AKT signaling by upregulating multiple extracellular growth factors (e.g. EGF), cytokines and their receptors [ ].	1
It would thus be ideally positioned to engage in post-recruitment conformational changes to Mediator that could result from its phosphorylation by ERK and, potentially, several other kinases.	2
Inputs that interfere with some of these interactions will shift this equilibrium, pushing the cell toward one extreme or the other (normal vs. tumorigenic).	2
Sequence analysis of EphB1 revealed that Y594 and Y600 are located in a region highly conserved in the Eph receptor family.	1
The experimental evidence presented above indicates that aryl hydrocarbon receptor does not require ARNT to mediate its off-target transrepressor effects.	1
E-cadherin is a cell-cell adhesion molecule that plays a key role in the development and maintenance of cell polarity.	1
Bam32 expression was also observed in trachea and placenta, but not in 14 other nonlymphoid tissues including brain, heart, kidney, liver and skeletal muscle, indicating that expression is largely confined to cells of the immune system.	2
These results indicate that, although phosphorylation of S1466//S1466 does not appear to affect Tiam1 localization, stability or activity, it is essential to allow Tiam1 to regulate centrosome separation and chromosome congression.	1
We showed that overexpression of GFP-RhoA S88A/T100A or GFP-RhoA S88E/T100E did not have any detectable effects on EGF-induced ERK phosphorylation ( ).	1
Thus it is important to find the molecular event that controls the localisation of ASPP2.	1
The cells were also assayed for FcɛRI expression levels, and receptor levels on the Bone marrow-derived mast cells after retroviral expression was identical to that of either linker for activation of T cells+/+ or linker for activation of T cells-/- Bone marrow-derived mast cells ( B).	1
It has been proposed that the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase is activated in response to EGF stimulation as a consequence of formation of EGFR/ErbB3 heterodimers [ ].	2
Our survey of several primary endothelial cells including, HUVEC, HMVE and BAEC cells showed that c-Src is ubiquitously tyrosine phosphorylated in response to VEGF stimulation ( ) and associates with VEGFR-2 in a ligand-dependent manner in these primary endothelial cells ( ).	1

Here we confirm the occurrence of this activity under nonstimulated conditions by the observation of a higher molecular weight band corresponding to phosphorylated Grb2 (also described by ) that is apparent in HEK293T cells overexpressing FGFR2 ( ).	1
This implies that the FGFR2-Grb2 complex does not abrogate signaling in the nonstimulated state simply because it sequesters Grb2 and thus prevents it from being recruited to son-of-sevenless.	2

Thus, T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule represents a transmembrane adaptor molecule that associates with the T Cell Receptor.	1
Our data suggest that these biological functions of PRL-3 are regulated by a Src family tyrosine kinase, and that this may be due to Src-mediated phosphorylation of tyrosine 53, a residue that we show here is both the major site of tyrosine phosphorylation and a requirement for full PRL-3 activity.	3
To test the extended hypothesis, we made a triple mutation (R64A/K71A/R74A, human α1 numbering, 'AAA mutant'), in the context of the recombinant human α1β2γ1 complex used in , of the three basic residues in the kinase domain that we propose to interact with phosphate groups on the ST loop.	2

This demonstrates that binding to, and hence dephosphorylation of Grb2 by Shp2 is, at least in part, mediated by the binding of phosphorylated Y542.	1
Additionaly, treatment with the recombinant Sonic Hedgehog partially reverted the drugs efficacy indicating that the combination's anti-metastatic activity is, at least in part, mediated by a secondary inhibition of GLI1.	2

The data indicated that p85 is phosphorylated on serine 83//S83 in vivo in these cell lines.	1
While statistically the detected changes in phosphorylation of peptides with fold change values 1.32-1.55 are less likely to be significant, this set of peptides includes known SRC targets such as p120 and p130Cas, supporting the hypothesis that such peptides may in fact be regulated by CSF-1R-induced SRC activation.	3

Interestingly, for the cell lines used in our study, OVCAR5 cells have no ErbB3 signaling and TOV21G and Igrov-1 cells express very low level of ErbB3 protein ( ), suggesting that ErbB3 and Gab2 expression contributes to activation of the PI3K pathway in different subset of ovarian cancer.	2
FGF2 may activate phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt signaling and its downstream GSK3β and mTOR pathways to induce β-catenin-dependent transcription including that of Slug.	3

Consistent with the ability of CARP-1 functional mimetics to inhibit growth of the breast and other cancer cells , we found that CARP-1 functional mimetics stimulate apoptosis signaling while suppressing molecules/pathways regulating Medulloblastoma cell cycle and cell growth.	1
The results presented here demonstrate that Gab1 is required for EGF-induced activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase pathway via the EGFR, presumably because this receptor does not contain binding sites for the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase.	1
Having defined PI3K/AKT signaling as a key effector pathway that cooperates with MAPK signaling to transform HME1 cells, we next sought to confirm that FAM83B-mediated transformation requires sustained PI3K/AKT activity.	1
This is most likely due to the fact that tyrosine-phosphorylated T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule migrates at a different position in isoelectric focussing than nonphosphorylated T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule (see, for example, Fig. ).	2
We conclude that single and combination treatment of AZD6244 and Everolimus block tumor growth in-vivo.	1
Although WT and S1466 to aspartic acid Tiam1 rescued the decrease in phospho-Pak1/2 seen on Tiam1 depletion in prophase, the S1466A mutant did not rescue the decrease ( ), suggesting that phosphorylation on this site is required for centrosomal Pak1/2 activation in mitosis.	2
We propose that while Pak1 phosphorylates BAD at serine 111, most of Pak1 protective effects are through Raf-1 mediated phosphorylation of BAD at serine 112 ( ).	2
This finding leads to the hypothesis that arsenic could somehow produce estrogenic-like effects, possibly directly or indirectly through stimulation of estrogen receptor-α, thus resulting in tumor formation ( ).	2
Dose-response experiments showed that optimal responses were reached at concentrations of 0.5-1 μg/ml for P19 cells and 1.5-3 μg/ml for CHO-EphB1 cells (unpublished data).	1
For the reconstitution studies, only cells that express low to medium levels of the respective SYNJ2 constructs were analyzed.	1

These data are consistent with the results of , showing that p120 can function as an inhibitory regulator of adhesion in Colo205 cells.	1
Consistent with uPAR signaling through the p130Cas-Crk complex, we find that p130Cas and Crk are required for Rac activation by uPAR and for the invasion of uPAR-expressing tumor cells. p130Cas is a multifunctional adaptor protein required for embryonic development and oncogenic signal transduction in tumor cells ( ; ; ; ; ).	1
Recent studies have shown that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase -AKT signalling pathway, one of the major oncogenic pathways, is frequently activated in adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma and is indispensable for the proliferation of adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma cells .	1
By screening a panel of diverse lipid-based plasma membrane targeting motifs we have identified a novel neuronal signaling mechanism that regulates plasma membrane levels of proteins with a polybasic-prenyl targeting motif.	1
Taken together, these results further demonstrate that Pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation or activation is selectively regulated by Fyn, but not Lck.	1
Given the apparent lack of any mechanism to degrade cytoplasmic p120, one possibility is that association with E-cadherin is an important means of restricting p120 access to the nucleus.	2
Our study revealed that HER2 and COX-2 expression were upregulated in non-small-cell lung cancer tissues and HER2 exhibited a significant positive correlation with the levels of COX-2 expression.	1
This suggests that resveratrol inhibition of PMA-induced COX-2 and MMP-9 is a Sirt1 independent event.	2
Thus, these data support the hypothesis that phosphorylation of nmMLCK by c-Abl regulates actin polymerization, but the possibility remains that dasatinib does not completely eliminate all residual c-Abl activity in these assays.	2
Taken together, these results suggest that TAS-116 enhances apoptosis induced by rat sarcoma-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway inhibitors including dabrafenib via mitochondrial damage in myeloma cells.	2
The arrows represent displacement of tracked cells, and colored lines are dragon tails that represent displaced trajectory of the cells tracked over time (Supplemental Movie S7). (c) Differentiated HL60 cells (average of two cells migrated in the tissue toward the tumor cells) labeled with DiI Cy5 (blue) are indicated by arrows.	1
Ectopically expressed EGFP-Rac1 proteins, wild-type or Y64F mutant, were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody and the membrane was blotted with anti GFP to demonstrate the expression level of EGFP-Rac1 proteins and also with anti-Flag antibody to reveal the Flag-βPIX that was co-immunoprecipitated with EGFP-Rac1 proteins.	1
Our study aimed to define the CSF-1R induced, SRC-regulated proteins in part to identify candidate SRC substrates that may regulate cell adhesion in MCF-10A cells .	3
It is necessary to mention that despite the fact that T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule comodulates with the T Cell Receptor complex in PBLs, so far we have not been able to demonstrate coprecipitation of T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule with CD3-ε in Digitonin lysates of such cells.	1
This data indicate that Gab2 via activation of the PI3K promotes Zeb1 gene expression.	1
The results have demonstrated that 88S//S88 and 100T//T100 of RhoA are phosphorylated by ERK.	1
Silencing expression of IQGAP1 and b-Raf revealed that their activity is essential for VEGF to stimulate angiogenesis in an in vivo angiogenesis model of chicken chorioallantoic membrane .	1
Thus, these data support the hypothesis that phosphorylation of nmMLCK by c-Abl increases nmMLCK binding to cortactin, but the possibility remains that dasatinib does not completely eliminate all residual c-Abl activity in this assay.	2
Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirm that under nonstimulated conditions FRS2 does not bind to FGFR2 (Fig. S1 D).	1
We propose that dual Thr-73//T73/Ser-189//S189 phosphorylation affects Shp2 activity by a mechanism in which phosphorylation at both sites disrupts N-capping interactions with the SH2 domains, leading to destabilization/melting of helix αB.	2
By way of additional confirmation that Grb2 was a substrate for Shp2 we used the substrate-trapping C459S mutant of Shp2 in the fluorescence spectroscopic assay.	1
Motifs were selected to ensure that the main known membrane anchor determinants (combinations of different lipids and/or polybasic regions) were represented.	1
As expected, treatment of Medulloblastoma cells with CARP-1 functional mimetic-1, -4, or -5 resulted in a significantly reduced number of Medulloblastoma cells that were able to migrate across the matrigel-coated membranes ( ).	2
In the cotransfection experiments, a molar ratio of 1:3 of the activated GTPases to the ECFP-Abi1 constructs was used so that all the epifluorescent cells also expressed the corresponding GTPase.	1
Similarly, we also found that Gab2 overexpression enhanced Zeb1 protein expression in OVCAR8 cells ( ).	1
The fraction of Rac1 that was bound to GTP, or the relative Rac1 activity was obtained by normalizing signal from the GST-p21-binding domain pull down assay to the total Rac1 band from the corresponding sample using a software-based algorithm.	1
Note that to compensate for protein levels, the amounts of DNA for CbyS18A/S20A, CbyS20A, and ChibbyΔ1-22 were appropriately increased for transfection, and hence, roughly similar expression levels were observed for all the Chibby mutants (bottom).	2
"It is likely that helix kα11 and the kα11-kα12 ""elbow"", on which these mutations reside, is an extension of the same site."	2
However, it seems unlikely that the trimerization of PRL-3 is affected by phosphorylation at tyrosine 53, which is distant from the trimer interface, based on the highly homologous sequence of PRL-1 , .	2
To our knowledge, we describe for the first time that HRAS mutations can be targeted by MEK and mTOR inhibitors.	2
We also found that P-REX1 activates IGF-1R/InsR, Rac1, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT, and MEK/ERK signaling, and promotes cell and tumor viability.	1
Altogether, the data show that c-Cbl, in part, facilitates association of Src with VEGFR-2.	1
Nonetheless, our findings indicate that the Chibby-14-3-3 interaction significantly contributes to their stable complex formation with β-catenin ( ).	1
Tan et al demonstrated that HER2/neu overexpression was significantly associated with histologic subtype of non-small-cell lung cancer and statistical significance was observed between HER2/neu expression and tumor differentiation, with strong positive expression observed more frequently in poorly differentiated tumors.	1
Interestingly, suppressed EGFR autophosphorylation on the Grb2 and c-Cbl binding sites correlated with receptor stability and sustained signaling, suggesting that HER2 accomplishes these tasks by altering autophosphorylation patterns.	2
Palacios and colleagues further demonstrated that E-cadherin sorting to the lysosome requires an intact Hrs ubiquitin-interacting motif, and E-cadherin was found to associate with Hrs in an ubiquitin-dependent manner .	1
Based on the results in , it was reasoned that exclusion of c-Cbl interaction by HER2 could lead to inhibition of ubiquitinylation.	2
We showed that ERK co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous RhoA with or without EGF stimulation in both COS-7 and SKBR-3 cells ( ).	1
"Further study has shown that low-birth-weight piglets differentiate low numbers of muscle fibers during prenatal myogenesis, and affected piglets do not exhibit postnatal ""catch-up"" growth ( )."	1
We conclude that BRAF is dispensable for MEK/ERK activation by PLX, and that CRAF expression is required for significant induction.	2
The centrosomal localization of p160ROCK raised the possibility that p160ROCK activity could affect centrosome structure or activity.	2
Initially, it was thought that sustained ERK activation caused cell differentiation, while transient ERK activation led not to proliferation, but to migration , .	2
Cells from Raf-1 knockouts also have wild type levels of ERK activation, suggesting that the survival signals are independent of MEK and ERK.	2
Immunoblotting analysis demonstrated that the increases in IRS (Insulin receptor substrate) phosphorylation correlated with increases in IRS1 and IRS2 protein expression in T47D-resistant and MCF7-resistant cells, respectively (Fig. ).	1
Both amino acids form the first position of an N-capping motif that precedes helix αB.	1
We identified two key amino acids in Shp2 that are phosphorylated by PKA.	1
We and others have shown that H1047R belongs to this type, which can be significantly activated by a phosphorylated receptor tyrosine kinase peptide (this study) or the adaptor protein IRS ( ).	1
Studies of receptor tyrosine kinases , including EGFR, demonstrate that the overall phosphorylation state is a net result of receptor tyrosine kinase and protein tyrosine phosphatase activities ( ).	1
Regulation of AKT activity is a tightly controlled event and its importance is evident from the pathological states that emerge due to the loss of this control.	2
Based on work in T cells, it is likely that the distal four tyrosine residues of linker for activation of T cells mediate important linker for activation of T cells-binding events ( ).	2
Blocking antibody and siRNA experiments showed that αvβ3 and αvβ5, but not uPAR, are required for adhesion to vitronectin (Fig. S5, A-C).	1
Therefore it is likely that dabrafenib, at high concentration ranges, inhibits c-Raf, resulting in blockage of c-Raf-dependent ERK activation and subsequent Death receptor 5 upregulation.	2
In the present work, using three cellular systems expressing endogenous or stably transfected EphB1, we provide evidences that the MAPK/ERK cascade plays a crucial role in EphB1-dependent cell migration.	1
We had previously established that ubiquitin-mediated degradation of RhoA or Rac1 is specifically impaired or inefficient in different immortalized and cancer cell lines, suggesting that several enzymes specifically target Rho protein members to ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation.	2
However, we certainly cannot exclude the possibility that particular tyrosine residues of T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule become phosphorylated by Syk and/or ZAP70 after T cell activation.	2
Moreover, in contrast to previous work, we found that over 90% of the cellular p120 was cadherin associated, suggesting a stoichiometric interaction.	2
To determine whether AKT Tyr176-phosphorylation is an upstream event that regulates AKT activation (or Ser473 phosphorylation, hereafter), site directed mutagenesis was performed to generate AKT phospho-tyrosine (Y176F) mutant ( ).	2
However, fibrosis that also develops during the healing process may hinder muscle regeneration ( ; ).	3
Thus, one might postulate that Sos-1 associates with the nucleotide-free form of Rac exclusively when engaged in the Sos-1-E3b1-Eps8 complex.	2
Collectively, these results suggested that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT pathway activation in adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma may be related to increased PTEN phosphorylation and potentially to the inactivation of NDRG2.	3
The evolutionarily conserved N-terminal 100 amino acids of ASPP1 and ASPP2 share high sequence homology with RAS-association domains present in c-Raf, PI3K and RasGDL, suggesting that ASPP1 and ASPP2 may interact with RAS.	3
Here we have developed a PTEN mutant, PTEN Y138L that retains wild-type PtdInsP3 lipid phosphatase activity, but in contrast to the wild-type enzyme, PTEN Y138L lacks activity against a model peptide substrate, polyGluTyrP and the soluble PtdInsP3 headgroup, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4.	2
Actin staining revealed discontinuities in the actin compaction ring that circumscribes cell colonies, reflecting apparent defects in the attachment of actin cables to peripheral sites of cell-cell contact ( A).	1
Moreover, protein sample derived from the same tissue showed that phosphorylation of PLCγ1 was significantly increased in c-Cbl knockout mice where VEGF was injected ( ).	1
Another interesting aspect of our finding is that PLCγ1 is mainly monoubiquitinated.	2
Therefore, we are currently attempting to identify the protein kinase(s) that target PTEN-Ser380/Thr382/Thr383, which has the potential to be a therapeutic drug target in a variety of cancers, including adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma.	2
These data directly demonstrate that, in agreement with the model, inhibition of MEK prevents the Rac to RhoA switch observed in cells migrating in an Rab-coupling protein/ α5β1/EGFR1 driven manner, and suggest that MEK-ERK signalling could indeed provide a feedback loop to periodically supress Rac activity and permit RhoA activation.	1
In sharp contrast, the C-terminally truncated mutant (β-cateninS33YΔC) was detected primarily in the nucleus, which implies that Chibby binding ultimately controls β-catenin distribution.	2
This suggests that fusion-induced apoptosis is relevant to {9016105=AS} pathogenesis, although syncytia are relatively infrequent in lymphoid tissues of human immunodeficiency virus-1+ donors .	2
Also in this case the concomitant mutation of Threonine 187//T187 was not able to rescue p27 stability ( ), demonstrating that the presence of A/G in the last position of p27 was dominant respect to the mutation of Threonine 187//T187.	1
One possible explanation for this property of ASPP2 is that, when RAS is activated, it binds active RAS and controls the intensity of the RAS signal.	2
These results are consistent with the observation that mutations removing the positive charges of the equivalent residues in p110γ prevent phosphatidylinositol(4,5)P2, but not phosphatidylinositol or phosphatidylinositol4P, from acting as a substrate ( ).	2
These data indicate that E-cadherin expression is sufficient to recruit p120 to cell-cell junctions.	1
Altogether these data demonstrate that the threonine 198A/G substitution causes an increased degradation of p27 protein but that this effect is not related to the binding with the Cyclin/CDK complexes.	1
Western blotting indicated that the level of pTpYERK in 3T3-B56γ1 cells after EGF+COL stimulation was slightly lower than that in 3T3 cells ( ).	1
These results suggest that mutant p53-R273H, but not other mutants, specifically regulate tumor cell survival through AKT-dependent suppression of AKT.	2
However, we have previously demonstrated ( ) that the three endogenous proteins also colocalize in vivo in dynamic actin structures.	1
As 32P-labeled probes, sequences from -135 to +29 of VEGF promoter that contains SAF-1-binding elements and a SAF-1-binding oligonucleotide of SAA promoter as described before were used.	1
Shp2 has two C-terminally located tyrosine residues (Y542 and Y580) that have been implicated in the mechanism for release of the auto-inhibited state of the phosphatase ( ).	1
We have previously shown that proteo-liposomes reconstituted with RLIP76 mediate ATP-dependent transport of doxorubicin and other drugs .	1
The kinetics of MEK activation was determined by western blotting of the active form of MEK, which is MEK that is phosphorylated at Ser217/221 (pMEK), using the same cell lysates as those used for analysis of the early kinetics of pTpYERK.	1
Considering that both PC-3 and DU 145 cell lines express a relatively lower level of KLF5 [ , ], we also overexpressed KLF5 by lentiviral infection in these two cell lines and performed human umbilical vein endothelial cell tube formation assay with conditioned media.	2
Experimental probing for potential interactions between tyrosine phosphorylation and either constitutive or dominant negative changes in Rac1 activation indicate that there may be separable and combinatorial actions of these two signaling mechanisms with regard to GTP loading, Rac1 targeting to focal adhesions, and cell spreading.	3
The R184C mutation completely abrogated membrane association ( B), providing support for the hypothesis that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent association of the Bam32 pleckstrin homology domain occurs through direct binding to PI(3,4,5)3.	2
Here we show that ASPP1 and ASPP2 bind active RAS.	1
It thus may be possible that the abnormal size or the distorted volume/surface ratio of syncytia, sensed via yet unknown mechanisms, activate the mTOR/FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein pathway and consequent cellular demise.	3
While molecular characterization of Klf5-null tumors suggested that angiogenesis was partially responsible for tumor promotion, the precise function and mechanism of KLF5 deletion in prostate tumor angiogenesis remain unclear.	2
It is likely that HS1-YF and HS1-FY are still associated with Syk even after B cell antigen receptor stimulation, which prevents Lyn from interacting with HS1.	2
It has been shown that switching of the polybasic regions between Rac1 and RhoA alters their nuclear accumulation [ ].	1
The results shown in illustrate that HRASV12 or KRASV12 alone had a small stimulatory effect on p53 transactivity.	1
In the present study, we have shown that RhoA is phosphorylated at additional sites, S88 and T100, by activated ERK (Figs - ).	1
It demonstrates that tyrosine phosphorylation of T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule is already detectable after 30 s of T cell activation, reaches a maximum after 1 min of stimulation, and then slowly declines within the next 40 min. 	1
We demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of p52Shc by Src family kinases is a prerequisite for its association with EphB1, on the one hand, and for recruitment of Grb2, on the other hand.	1
For protein analysis that included siRNA treatment, cells were transfected for 6 h and then starved in serum free media for 24 h prior to ligand treatments.	1
Further analysis of PARP1 activity on the liver kinase B1 pathway in Small cell lung cancer cell lines showed that liver kinase B1 expression and phosphorylation of AMPKα were both lower in PARP1 knockdown cells than in cells treated with scramble short-hairpin RNA ( ).	1
The level of Erk1/2 phosphorylation was increased by FGF2 in both untreated and treated cells with doxycycline for 12 h, but not in cells treated with doxycycline for 48 h, although the basal Erk1/2 phosphorylation level was similar to that in cells treated with doxycycline for 12 h. 	1
To understand how Gab2 regulates E-cadherin expression and migration/invasion in ovarian cancer cells, we expressed Gab2 wild type and Gab2 mutants that are defective in activating the PI3K (ΔPI3K) and Shp2 (ΔShp2) pathways in OVCAR5 cells ( ).	2
Coprecipitation of C subunit with B56α1 and B56γ1 was detected, and that with B56β1 was not detected when cells with the same count were used ( ).	1
CXCR7 controls CXCL12 gradients required for migration ( ; ; ), and it is possible that CXCR7 is playing a role in sequestration of CXCL12 and CXCL11 in 3D rBM cultures.	2
Our detailed analysis addressed the specificity of ETP-45658, analysing the effect in a broad panel of kinases that represent almost all key families within the human kinome.	1
Our further studies showed that in an in vitro kinase assay recombinant c-Src protein phosphorylates GST-fusion IQGAP1 (data not shown).	1
Y1173//Y1173 of VEGFR-2 is considered to be a bona fide mediator of angiogenic signaling of VEGFR-2 in vivo since its mutation abrogates its ability to stimulate angiogenesis during mouse embryonic development , and Y1173 functions as a multi-docking residue on VEGFR-2 that recruits p85/PI3kinase, PLCγ1, Shb, and Sck - , .	2
These results indicate that the Orf virus-encoded protein 002 N-terminus (residues 1-52) mediates NF-κB p65 acetylation at Lys310 as effectively as the whole Orf virus-encoded protein 002 protein.	1
Our results showed that fangchinoline significantly suppressed the migratory and invasive ability of SGC7901 in parallel with downregulation of Matrix metalloproteinase9 and Matrix metalloproteinase2.	1
Taken together, these results suggest that fangchinoline targets PI3K in tumor cells that express PI3K abundantly and inhibits the growth and invasive ability of the tumor cells.	2
We recently demonstrated that the C-terminal portion of p27 is important for its ability to control MT stability via stathmin interaction and this, in turn, impinge on cell motility - , .	1
It cannot be formally excluded that Eps8, E3b1, and Sos-1 associate after cell lysis, thus allowing coimmunoprecipitation.	2
Once activated by stress, AMP-activated protein kinase switches on the uptake of glucose and fatty acids and the oxidative metabolism of these fuels to generate ATP, while switching off biosynthetic pathways that consume ATP.	1
Furthermore, we have presented data that show that EGFR contributes significantly to HER2-induced tumorigenesis in xenograft mice models.	1
Interventions aimed at providing renoprotection, such as ACE-inhibition or statin therapy, can reduce the renal mitogen-activated protein kinase expression, suggesting that increased renal mitogen-activated protein kinase expression is involved in the pathophysiology of kidney damage.	2
Previously, we have found that 14-3-3ζ overexpression in this cohort is associated with reduced disease-free survival ( ).	1
Furthermore, quantification of chorioallantoic membrane assay showed that VEGF treatment of chorioallantoic membrane induced robust angiogenic response where IQGAP1-siRNA, c-Src-siRNA and b-Raf-siRNA each decreased VEGF-induced angiogenesis ( ).	1
Conversely, the prolactin receptor and EGFR were decreased in arsenic-induced hepatocellular carcinoma, thereby suggesting that the dysregulation of cell-cell communications and signal transduction pathways could be another important aspect of arsenic hepatocarcinogenesis, as has been proposed for liver cancer in general.	2
However, given that the majority of active Smad2/3 is still able to translocate into the nucleus despite the presence of T220/T179 phosphorylation ( ), this suggests that additional factors that interact with active Smad2/3 may hinder the recruitment of Nedd4L and prevent their degradation.	3
These data indicate that other differentially activated signaling pathways, rather than the predicted difference in AKT activity underlie differential sensitivity of the osteosarcoma cell lines to MEK inhibition.	1
The levels of pro-NTF3 in the transfected cells and the viabilities of the transfected cells that were either untreated or treated with CARP-1 functional mimetic-4 or CARP-1 functional mimetic-5 were determined by WB and MTT assays, respectively.	1
The model predicts that breaking the negative feedback loop activity via MEK1/2 removal leads to persistent (rather than cyclic) activity of the Sos1-Eps8-Abi1 complex which causes subsequent persistent activation of Rac1 and suppression of RhoA activity and thus a reduction in invasive cell migration.	2
Uniquely among the four class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase isoforms that produce PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, p110α has been identified with activating cancer-linked somatic mutations ( ).	2
Next, we investigated the role of the mTOR pathway in FGF2-induced E-cadherin down-regulation, because mTOR is a pathway downstream of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt signaling that has been shown to be involved in E-cadherin down-regulation .	1
We found that incubation with Src significantly enhanced SYNJ2 5'-phosphatase activity ( ).	1
Although further clinical and mechanistic studies are needed for this combination treatment, the data presented here warrant that all-trans retinoic acid coupled with TAK165 may lead to new applications of differentiation-based approaches for acute myeloid leukemia and other leukemia therapies.	3
The result showed that loss of c-Cbl increases the capillary tube formation of endothelial cells ( ).	1
Using in vitro transcription-translation assays we also excluded that the differences in protein expression resided in the ability of the mRNA to be correctly translated in protein since similar amount of protein was produced in vitro per each nanogram of plasmid used ( ).	1
The follow-up fluorescein angiography of the lesions showed that they were lesions were progressively larger in size at the 4-week as compared to the earlier time points in the c-Cbl knockout mice ( ).	1
Although we have not observed any obvious effects of phosphorylation on subcellular localization by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (data not shown), it is possible that phosphorylation induces more subtle differences that are nevertheless functionally important, such as restriction to specific membrane-binding sites.	1
Anderson et al. [ ] have recently reported evidence suggesting that CaMKKβ can form a stable complex with the α and β subunits of AMPK in the absence of a γ subunit.	2
Additionally, the phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Akt pathway that regulates NOS and GSK3β is required to control cell migration and angiogenesis. , There are also reports that the phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Akt signaling pathway is involved in breast, lung, gastric, and prostate cancers that become refractory to cytotoxic therapy.	2
Scoring cells for chromosome congression errors similarly demonstrated that, whereas WT and S1466 to aspartic acid Tiam1 rescued the increased chromosome congression errors seen on Tiam1 depletion, S1466A mutation was unable to rescue the phenotype ( ).	1

This identified Elm1, Pak1 and Tos3 as alternative upstream kinases in yeast that can activate the SNF1 complex in vivo in a partially redundant manner [ ].	2
Knocking down of Shp2 in A431 (Shp2i, ) in the presence of Grb2 shows a small increase in receptor phosphorylation under nonstimulated conditions, suggesting that Shp2 is a phosphatase for FGFR2 and that Grb2 inhibition of Shp2 activity in normal cells is not 100% effective.	1
That being the case, what are the upstream signals that regulate the ARKs?	3
Since these mutants associated with and stabilized α- and β-catenins, it is clear that the physical connection to the actin cytoskeleton mediated by these catenins is not sufficient by itself to drive compaction.	1
Confirming the importance of Ras for this anchorage-dependent survival pathway, we determined that expression of constitutively activated Ras rescued rabbit synovial fibroblasts from apoptosis triggered by green fluorescent protein-focal adhesion targeting ( ).	1
However there have been several reports suggesting that Shp2 may specifically de-phosphorylate the tyrosine phosphorylation sites on Gab1 that bind to p85, thus terminating recruitment of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and EGF-induced activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase pathway [ - ].	3
Treatment efficacy was determined by comparing the tumor volume from drug-treated mice (ΔT) with that from mice treated with vehicle (ΔC) using the ratio (ΔT/ΔC) at day 19 for NCI-H1048 and day 25 for NCI-H209 [ ] (last measurement of vehicle treated tumors).	1
A previous study has demonstrated that phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and ERK signaling pathway induces the VEGF expression as well as promotes an increase in the development of choroidal neovascularization .	1
Cloning of the corresponding polypeptide resulted in the identification of a novel disulfide-linked dimeric transmembrane adaptor protein (gp30/40) that is exclusively expressed in lymphocytes (Klode, J., A. Marie-Cardine, H. Kirchgessner, E. Bruyns, A. Shevchenko, M. Mann, and B. Schraven, manuscript in preparation).	1
In a living cell, the situation is likely more complex, as supported by findings that Rac-GEFs assemble into macromolecular complexes that are essential for efficient catalysis and for proper subcellular targeting.	2
Our analysis showed that co-expression of v-Src with non-chimeric wild-type VEGFR-2 in a transient transfection of HEK-293 cells also increases phosphorylation of Y1173 ( ), where phosphorylation of Y1052, Y1057 and Y1212 were not effected ( ).	1
Moreover, as shown in , compared with the HL60R-pCCL cells, a significant activation of STAT1 was detected in the HL60R-RARα cells treated with all-trans retinoic acid plus TAK165, which further indicated that the differentiation induced by all-trans retinoic acid and TAK165 combination is RARα-dependent.	1
Our data ( ) demonstrate that AKT in the plasma membrane is phosphorylated at Tyr 176 and mutation of this site in AKT abrogates appearance of AKT in the plasma membrane ( ).	1
The RNAs from each group were hybridized with gene-array chips, and the data were analyzed to identify genes that had a significant 1.5-fold or higher altered expression following CARP-1 functional mimetic-4 treatments.	2
Using mouse models for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma , we found that abrogating SMYD3 catalytic activity inhibits tumor development in response to oncogenic Ras.	1
It has been reported that ROCK1 is activated when it binds to RhoA, and ROCK1 promotes the formation of actin stress fibers and adhesion complexes [ - ].	2
They also provide an explanation for our previous findings [ ] that agents that cause increases in AMP (e.g. phenformin) or that are converted into an AMP mimetic (AICAR) do not increase phosphorylation and activation of AMPK in HeLa cells.	1
Anti-MRP IgG also inhibited doxorubicin-transport in a saturable manner, but the inhibition was less (24±4%) as compared to that observed with anti-RLIP76 IgG.	2
This observation is important because it emphasizes that receptor phosphorylation alone is not sufficient for signal transduction.	2
We observed a temporal increase in smad2 linker region phosphorylation that was dependant on MEK activitivation of Erk, as treatment with U0216 abolished linker region phosphorylation ( ).	1
These data indicate that ARNT function as it relates to estrogen receptor signaling is likely dictated by other factors specific to the cellular environment.	2
As observed with CA-RAF and CA-MEK, cells expressing constitutively active PI3K alone or constitutively active AKT alone were unable to grow anchorage-independently, arguing that simply elevating AKT activity is insufficient for transformation.	2
In this study we revealed that the N-terminus of Orf virus-encoded protein 002 inhibits nuclear factors κB from stimulating transcription by blocking phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 Ser276 but not Ser536.	1
Comparative marker analysis identified SHP2 as one of the 12 phosphatases that define the classical subgroup ( ).	1
Our data suggest Pak1 and Raf-1 cooperate to maintain BAD phosphorylation at serine 112 but not at serine 111, and that MEK signaling is not involved in phosphorylation at either site.	2
Pretreatment with brefeldin A (a fungal metabolite that disrupts the Golgi) only partially inhibited KRas-tail accumulation in perinuclear membranes (Fig. S2, available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200409157/DC1), suggesting that CFP-KRas-tail also localizes to another juxtanuclear compartment.	2
If RAS is only temporarily active, as happens in natural growth conditions, one could hypothesize that ASPP2 would bind active RAS, potentiate its downstream pathways, and mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation of ASPP2 would lead to increased binding to p53.	3
When the control shRNA-HER2 mice developed tumors that were ≥ 1 cm in diameter, all mice were sacrificed, pictures collected, tumors retrieved and their weights measured.	1
We measured prophase intercentrosomal distance in these pools following transient transfection with Tiam1 siRNA, and found again that WT and S1466 to aspartic acid Tiam1 could rescue the increased intercentrosomal distance seen on Tiam1 depletion, whereas S1466A was unable to rescue ( ).	2
This indicates that phosphorylation of endogenous PRL-3 requires the activity of at least one member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, and supports a model in which an Src family kinase acts upstream of PRL-3 to cause its phosphorylation in vivo.	1
Interestingly, Net1 colocalizes with these proteins in discrete punctate nuclear structures that are associated with promyelocytic leukemia bodies.	1
Crk was the first example of an SH2/SH3 adaptor, a family of small proteins that lack catalytic domains but contain multiple modular protein binding domains.	1

( ) found suppression of integrin function and down-regulation of ERK1/2 after activation of EphA2 in prostate carcinoma cells.	1
We next tested the effects of Akt on either WT, S487A or S491A mutants of active α1β2γ1 and α2β2γ1 complexes. (A) shows that with the α1β2γ1 complex there was slight phosphorylation of Ser487 even in the absence of Akt, although phosphorylation of this site increased markedly with increasing Akt.	1
Several studies have shown that inhibition of Aurora kinases leads to cell death in osteosarcoma [ , ].	1

As the levels of RAS activation induced by growth factors such as EGF or insulin in primary cells in normal growth conditions is lower than that in cancer cells caused by mutation or amplifications of RAS or EGFR genes, this cellular localisation of ASPP2 and its binding partners may differ between primary cells and cancer cells.	3
We have previously shown that Rab-coupling protein-mediated α5β1/EGFR trafficking controls localised signalling [ ] and hence it is likely that this apparent discrepancy is due to spatially restricted effects on cell signalling in cells that lack constitutive ERK activation.	1
Our previous studies of the lipid phosphatase activity of TPIP and TPTE revealed that TPIP has similar PtdInsP3 phosphatase activity to PTEN, and that while TPTE lacks detectable activity in the assays used, it could be reactivated through mutation, producing an active phosphatase termed 'TPTE-reactivated' ( ; ).	1
β-Catenin (armadillo in Drosophila melanogaster) is a multifunctional protein that participates in several cellular processes, including cell-cell adhesion and the canonical Wnt signaling ( ).	2
Basal-like tumors preferentially metastasize to distant organs, such as the lung and brain ( ), so it is not surprising that MCF-7 CXCR4ΔCTD cells metastasize to the lungs ( ).	2
germinal center B cells begin a complex differentiation program that incorporates somatic hypermutation coupled with selection for high-affinity antigen-specific Ig, Ig class switching, and differentiation into memory B cells or plasma cells.	1
In this paper, we show for the first time, that Ras is involved in the activation of SAF-1 and utilizes MAPK-signaling pathway.	1
To further confirm that Gab2 expression affects E-cadherin protein expression, western blot analysis was used to assess E-cadherin protein expression in ovarian cancer cells with Gab2 overexpression or Gab2 knocking down.	1
In view of the fact that these mice are systemically ill, a reasonable caveat for this result is that there may be other unknown factors contributing to the complete absence of response.	3
Therefore, HER2-induced tumorigenesis is dependent on EGFR, suggesting that the normally-expressed EGFR may potentiate the oncogenic property of HER2 in HER2-positive breast cancer.	3
Disruption of the C2-inter-SH2 domain (C420R and p85α-N564D) or the C2/helical-N-terminal SH2 domain contacts (E545K) could expose hydrophobic regions in the C2 domain that are normally inaccessible to lipid binding.	2
The above observations indicate that the recruitment of phosphoinositide 3-kinase by Abi1 into an Eps8-Abi1-Sos-1 complex is necessary and sufficient to activate, in vitro, the Rac-GEF capability of the latter.	1
This strongly suggests that Shp2 is a substrate for basal FGFR2 kinase activity and thus the receptor is able to enhance phosphatase activity.	1
Furthermore, the conserved Domain of Unknown Function 1669 is critical for the transforming activity of FAM83B and we postulate that other FAM83 members may also function as oncogene given the conservation of this domain.	3
S4 shows that EphB1-Y594 associates with c-Src (top) and stimulates MAPK/ERK (bottom).	1
This strongly suggests that constitutive activation of the Raf/MAP kinase pathway by oncogenic Ras causes transcriptional downregulation of Tiam1 expression, leading to decreased Rac activity and transition to a mesenchymal phenotype.	1
Although autophosphorylation of tyrosine 1173//Y1173 (Y1173)//Y1173 of VEGFR-2 is considered a focal point for its angiogenic signal relay, however, the mechanism of phosphorylation of Y1173, signaling proteins that are recruited to this residue and their role in angiogenesis is not fully understood.	2
Recently, we showed that Src phosphorylates Ras on tyrosine 32 within the switch I region, which decreased the association between Raf and Ras while enhancing the binding of GAP to Ras to promote GTP hydrolysis and the inactivation of Ras .	1
Similarly, the selective activity of PTEN Y138L against the lipid PtdInsP3, but not the identical soluble headgroup, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, strongly suggests to us that the active site of PTEN Y138L is only available for substrate binding when the enzyme interacts with a lipid surface.	1
These results suggest that Tiam1-mediated Rac activity is required for full activation of Pak1/2 on centrosomes in prophase, and that this change in Pak activity does not influence Aurora A activation.	2

However, the double RhoA mutants, including both the alanine mutant that are unable to be phosphorylated by ERK (GST-RhoA S88A/T100A) and phosphomimetic RhoA mutant (GST-RhoA S88E/T100E), bind to ERK at a much lower level than the wild type RhoA ( ).	2
A third possibility might be that the intrinsically low tyrosine kinase activity of HER2 ( , ) may lead to phosphorylation of some, but not all sites on EGFR and HER2 itself, leading to differential autophosphorylation patterns.	3
These results provide the first description of a physiological substrate for the LKB1 tumor suppressor and suggest that it functions as an upstream regulator of AMP-activated protein kinase.	2

There is a possibility that HSP20 directly binds to one of the subunits of phosphoinositide 3-kinase dimers and that another subunit of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase dimer is coimmunoprecipitated.	2
Additional significance for this observation is provided by our findings that the growth and tumorigenicity of transformed cells harboring mutant RAS or elevated EGFR expression can be significantly suppressed following FAM83B ablation.	2
Various studies, both in vitro and in vivo, have shown that the administration of certain drugs acts as the stimulus to trigger various mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades, thus mediating cellular responses to kidney injury [ ].	1
This band was not present in unstimulated cells and comigrated with the 35/36 kD band detected by antiphosphotyrosine blotting, indicating that it represents tyrosine-phosphorylated Bam32.	1
Our results show that Src kinase activity leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of PRL-3, primarily on Y53.	1
Since many of these are known targets of SRC, it is likely that SRC molecules activated by integrin receptor engagement, rather than SRC recruitment to CSF-1R, are responsible for these phosphorylation events. 35% (112/324) of peptides detected were classified as SRC-inhibited ( ).	2
We already demonstrated that p27 is able to inhibit the motility of several human cancer cell lines, including HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells ( ) and and U87MG in transwell migration assays.	1
The interaction between T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule and the TCR-CD3-ζ complex was further substantiated by our observation that 60-70% of the T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule molecules comodulate with the TCR-CD3 complex in T cell lines and PBLs (Fig. B, and Fig. ).	2
These agents are likely to be given to patients with tumours in which PTEN function is believed to be compromised, although as yet, in many tumour types, it is still possible that phosphoinositide 3-kinase independent pathways may be of great importance.	3
White lines indicate that intervening lanes have been spliced out.	1
Altogether, the data suggest that c-Cbl activity in endothelial cells negatively controls VEGF-dependent cell proliferation.	2
Thus, in light of these results and previous finding, we conclude that a Sos-1-Grb2 complex directs Ras activation through binding to receptor tyrosine kinases, whereas a S/E complex directs Rac activation by entering into a tricomplex with Eps8 ( ).	1
The observation of BAD serine 111 phosphorylation in a lung cancer cell line and several malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor cell lines suggests that serine 111 phosphorylation could be used as pharmacodynamic marker of Pak activity in some cancers.	2
The finding that Sos-1 participates in both Ras and Rac activation does not immediately explain the temporal sequence by which the activation of Ras precedes that of Rac.	1
In a multivariate model including molecular subtype, P-REX1 status (high/low) was not independently predictive of sensitivity to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibition, suggesting that P-REX1 expression is tightly linked with molecular subtype.	1
This indicates that Rac negatively influences Rho activity under conditions where Rho is not activated by separate pathways, such as HGF-receptor stimulation.	1
In light of the fact that NTF3 is a preferred ligand for TrkC receptor, and although low levels of 5.5-kb size alternate splice variant of TrkC mRNA were present in Daoy cells, no detectable levels of the 14-kb trkC, p75NTR, trkA, or trkB mRNAs as well as full-length p145trkC receptor protein were found in these cells ( and refs within).	1
The failure of p120 to associate with these contacts shows definitively that the presence of functional cadherin is not only sufficient, but also necessary, for recruitment of p120 to cell-cell junctions.	1
We further found that U0126, an MEK inhibitor, abolished HER2-induced COX-2 expression in A549 cells, indicating that HER2 induced COX-2 upregulation by MEK/ERK pathway.	2
It is important to note that the effects driven downstream of Rab-coupling protein-mediated trafficking are localised specifically to the leading edge of cells because this is the location of vesicular trafficking [ , ], and hence global effects throughout the cell might not be expected.	2
The experiment presented in Fig shows that ectopic expression of Gab1 in the Gab1 deficient cells rescues EGF-induced Akt activation to levels similar to those observed in EGF-treated wild type MEFs.	1
It has long been known that human breast tumors have low percentage of activating Ras mutations , but that does not necessarily mean that Ras plays no role in breast cancer.	2

The results of this study demonstrate that the hypertrophic effect of isoproterenol is inhibited by expression of the Shp2 T73A/S189A mutant, whereas expression of the T73D/S189D mutant significantly increases myocyte size in the absence of isoproterenol stimulation.	1
These results demonstrate that the Shank3 adaptor protein can mediate cellular signaling, and provide a molecular mechanism for the biological divergence between the Ret9 and Ret51 isoform.	1

It is generally recognized that phosphoinositide 3-kinase is an upstream kinase of AKT , .	1
Our findings indicate that the tumors in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome could result from deficient activation of AMP-activated protein kinase as a consequence of LKB1 inactivation.	1
Although Ser487//S487 in the human α1β2γ1 complex also appeared to autophosphorylate to a limited extent in cell-free assays ( A), increased Ser487 phosphorylation did not occur when intact cells were incubated with the AMPK activator berberine ( C), suggesting that autophosphorylation of Ser487 is not significant in intact cells.	2
It has been reported that the Ras protein acts at a point upstream of both phosphoinositide 3-kinase and ERK .	1
Furthermore, these data show that mutation of Y1139//Y1139 in HER2, the putative Grb2-binding autophosphorylation site, does not perturb transforming ability, suggesting that Y1139 in HER2 may not play any significant role.	3
Expanding on our previous observations that 1) sensitivity to PARP inhibition is related inversely to PI3K/mTOR pathway activity [ ] and 2) PARP inhibition increased PI3K/mTOR signaling, we tested the anti-proliferation efficacy of a PI3Kα inhibitor (BKM-120) in our panel of 50 Small cell lung cancer cell lines.	1

Phenformin and 2-deoxyglucose did not cause phosphorylation of ACC or AMPK, or activation of AMPK, in HeLa cells that had not been treated with a Ca2+ ionophore, despite the fact that 2-deoxyglucose produced a large rise in ADP/ATP ratio (any small effect of phenformin on the ADP/ATP ratio was not significant).	1
The results of the present study show that the ARKs, unlike AMPK itself, are not regulated by increases in cytosolic Ca2+ via activation of CaMKK.	1
The finding that phospholipase Cγ2 but not phospholipase Cγ1 can be detected in Bam32 immunoprecipitates is intriguing, and could be due to differences in the tyrosine-phosphorylation motifs present in these two isoforms .	2
These studies suggest that Gab2 might promote cancer metastasis by regulating the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.	2
Also, the previously described mutations in the A subunit genes that contribute to tumorigenesis may function to disrupt the same pathway as this B56γ mutation, therefore making B56γ mutations in these cancer types less likely.	3

S1466//S1466 is located to the C terminus of the catalytic DH-PH domain of Tiam1 and the Cdk1 consensus sequence is conserved in higher species ( ), suggesting that this site may be important for Tiam1 function.	3

In this setting, the half life of p27Y74F-threonine 198A and p27Y88F-threonine 198A was about 5 hours, thus similar to the p27threonine 198A mutant, while that of the single p27Y74F and p27Y88F was about 15 hours, thus longer than that of the WT protein (12 hours of half-life).	1

We repeatedly observed only partial translocation of CaM to the plasma membrane in KRas-tail-expressing cells, possibly because of high endogenous levels of CaM (relative to exogenous YFP-CaM and CFP-KRas-tail) that could compete with exogenous YFP-CaM for CFP-KRas-tail binding sites at the plasma membrane.	2
The p53 protein is a tumor suppressor that functions as a sequence-specific transcription factor regulating the expression of various target genes involved in apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, DNA repair, senescence, and inhibition of angiogenesis and metastasis.	1

It has been shown that low concentrations of a growth factor induce cell proliferation but not cell migration, whereas higher concentrations induce cell migration on a matrix and inhibit cell proliferation , .	1
As a positive control, we used a Jurkat variant that was stably transfected with chimera_F, whereas a Jurkat variant that stably expresses a wild-type A2.1 molecule (Pete 2.1 cell line [11]) served as negative control.	1
To show that phosphorylation of Ser487//S487 on AMPK-α1 by Akt could also reduce subsequent activation by CaMKKβ, we used the LKB1-null G361 melanoma cell line.	2

In previous work, we showed that activated EphB1 recruits the adaptor protein Nck and the low molecular weight phosphatase LMW-PTP through involvement of Y594 and Y929 tyrosine residues ( , ).	1
This result suggested that the effect of the Y138L mutation was not to alter the precise conformation of the active site to accommodate the headgroup of PtdInsP3 yet exclude phosphotyrosine, but might alter the conformation of the phosphatase on a larger scale, favouring lipid substrates presented at a membrane interface over soluble substrates.	3
The lower panel shows the transfected cells that were studied with the line scan used for kymograph.	1

Overexpression of Bam32 in BJAB cells to levels that inhibit nuclear factor of activated T cells activation by >50% does not lead to detectable changes in B cell antigen receptor-induced Ca2+ flux (data not shown); however, it remains possible that Bam32 regulates the sustained phase of the Ca2+ response, which is Btk dependent and critical for full activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells-dependent transcription .	1

These attributes suggest that activated Ack1 could engage AKT at the plasma membrane.	3
FGF2 has been shown to activate the MAPK/ERK pathway in various cancer cells , , and we show in OVCAR-4 and SKOV-3 cells that ZEB1 expression is MAPK/ERK-dependent.	1
The poor interaction of c-Cbl and Grb2 with HER2-containing complexes provides further evidence that HER2 may not be phosphorylated on Y1112 and Y1139.	2
It has been reported that PIK3A and PIK3R1, the genes that respectively encode the phosphoinositide 3-kinase p110α and phosphoinositide 3-kinase p85 subunits, are somatically mutated in many cancers, including liver cancer, and that these mutations promote the activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKT pathway and oncogenesis , .	1
Decreased PARP activity and increased cleaved PARP expression suggest that the two inhibitors inhibit proliferation by different, complementary mechanisms (cytotoxic PARP trapping versus apoptosis).	2
It is likely that Ras could increase recruitment of p110α to lipid membrane.	2
This was also true in the present study because we showed that approximately 70% of the total AMPK activity could be immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibody, with the remaining 30% (representing a small proportion with endogenous α subunits) being subsequently precipitated using anti-α1 or anti-α2 antibodies.	2

Here we report that MED14, a core subunit of the Mediator, is a bona fide ERK substrate and identify serine 986 within a serine-proline rich region of MED14 as the major ERK phosphorylation site.	1
Our previous report indicated that the Orf virus-encoded protein 002 gene inhibits the nuclear factors κB signaling pathway by decreasing TNF-α.	2
The substrate specificity of PTEN Y138L therefore may suggest that its active site can only be available for substrate binding when the enzyme interacts with a lipid surface.	2
This suggests that the greatest therapeutic gain may be achieved by targeting the counteracting protein tyrosine phosphatase.	2
Although it had been proposed that AMP promoted phosphorylation of AMPK by LKB1 [ ], previous studies suggest that this may have been caused by trace contamination of the kinase preparations used with protein phosphatase, and that the effect of AMP on Thr172 phosphorylation is entirely via inhibition of dephosphorylation [ ].	2

Consistent with the finding from mouse prostates [ ], Western blotting demonstrated that both stable and transient knockdown of KLF5 in PC-3 and DU 145 cells increased, and ectopic expression of KLF5 decreased, the expression of activated AKT (p-AKT) (Figure A, B).	1

One possible explanation for this finding is that SRC activates a phosphatase that targets these proteins.	2
These studies, performed in linker for activation of T cells-deficient Jurkat cells, showed that cells reconstituted with a mutant lacking these four residues failed to signal at all.	1
An in vitro assay also showed that a mutation at serine 111//S111 does not influence PKA phosphorylation of BAD at serine 112 ( ).	1
We also demonstrated that the overexpressed HSP20 protein in the HuH7 cells was also immuoprecipitated by HSP20 antibodies ( ).	1
In the context of concurrent deletions of KLF5 and PTEN in human prostate cancer, our findings further suggest that during the development of human prostate cancer, KLF5 loss and PTEN loss cooperate to enhance tumor angiogenesis by upregulating hypoxia inducible factor 1α and VEGF, which remains to be examined.	3

We previously showed that Y594//Y594 in EphB1 binds to the SH2 domain of Nck and is essential for JNK and integrin activation by EphB1 ( ; ).	1
These data suggest that the direct connection of E-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton through β-catenin, α-catenin, and other factors such as α-actinin, are not sufficient for E-cadherin's ability to induce compaction.	2
A similar biochemical approach showed that CaM also interacts with the COOH-terminal tail of Rap1a, in a Ca2+-dependent manner ( a).	1
Therefore, it is possible that multiple, potentially redundant, pathways activate Pak1/2 to promote mitotic entry.	2

These results demonstrate that the four distal tyrosines are critical for linker for activation of T cells-dependent signaling in mast cells after FcɛRI engagement.	1
It has been reported that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR signaling plays a critical role in regulation of autophagy, and targeting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR signaling has been proposed to be a promising strategy for cancer therapy. - Therefore, we initially examined phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase at Tyr458, AMPK at Thr172, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase at Thr180/Tyr182, which are upstream signaling molecules regulating the Akt/mTOR pathway and have an important role in regulation of cell survival and cell death. , Treatment of the cells with danusertib significantly inhibited phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase at Tyr458, but did not significantly affect expression of total phosphatidylinositol-4 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase when compared with the control.	2
In this study we show that transformation of normal MCF-10A breast epithelial cells by constitutively active, oncogenic Ras, induces the DNA-binding activity and transcription function of SAF-1.	1

Our findings in Mouse embryonic fibroblasts suggest that RAC1 and CDC42 cooperatively control steady-state phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity in living cells by isoform-specific activation of p110β and that this requires the p110β RAS-binding domain.	2
PTP1B, LMW-PTP and Shp-2 are each reported to be phosphorylated on tyrosines with functional consequences of that modification - .	1

These data indicated that RhoA and ERK interaction is mediated mostly by RhoA docking site, but is also affected by the ERK phosphorylation sites S88 and T100. (A) The effects of RhoA phosphorylation on its interaction with ERK.	2
Thus, Y63//Y63 and Y110//Y110 are part of YxxL sequences that could bind to the src homology 2 domains of src-PTKs, whereas Y79 belongs to a YxxM motif which has the potential to bind to the src homology 2 domain of the 85-kD regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( ).	2
Collectively, these results demonstrate that the sensitization of Ras-mutant cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by B-Raf inhibition is also dependent on the activation of c-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling.	1
These results suggest that both 88SP and 100TP are phosphorylated by ERK in response to EGF.	2
First, during previous extensive efforts to purify from rat liver extracts activities that activate dephosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase, ([ ] and subsequent unpublished work), we have not detected any activities other than AMP-activated protein kinase kinase1 and AMP-activated protein kinase kinase2, at least under the assay conditions used.	1

Our results suggest that resveratrol may prevent blood-brain barrier disruption during neuroinflammation by inhibiting MMP-9 and COX-2 and act as a pharmacological NF-κB signal transduction inhibitor independent of Sirt1.	2
In light of earlier findings demonstrating p38 activation during Medulloblastoma cell apoptosis , and together with our recent report describing identification and characterization of novel small molecule CARP-1 functional mimetics, in particular the CARP-1 functional mimetic-4 that binds with CARP-1, increases CARP-1 levels, p38 activation and apoptosis , we speculated that CARP-1 expression and p38 activation are key events in Medulloblastoma cell apoptosis signal transduction in the presence of Adriamycin or CARP-1 functional mimetics.	1
In this study we demonstrate that c-Src kinase directly through its Src homology 2 domain and indirectly via c-Cbl binds to phospho-Y1057 of VEGFR-2.	1
However, approximately 50% of all human cancers contain a mutation in the TP53 gene, with the majority of these mutations occurring within the DNA-binding domain, causing an impaired binding of p53 to the DNA. , , , Unlike most tumor-suppressor genes, which are predominantly inactivated by deletions or truncating mutations during cancer progression, the TP53 gene in human tumors is often found to undergo missense mutations that produce a full-length protein containing only a single amino acid substitution with a greatly prolonged half-life. , Most of the cancer-associated TP53 mutations can be ascribed to two main classes: DNA contact and conformational mutants.	2
The phosphorylation of Bam32 correlates with a bandshift of 2-3 kD on our SDS-PAGE gels, suggesting that either (a) phosphorylation at tyrosine 139 leads a stable conformational change that retards the migration of Bam32, (b) phosphorylation at tyrosine 139 is upstream of multiple phosphorylations by serine/threonine kinases, or (c) Bam32 is phosphorylated on multiple tyrosines not conforming to the consensus tyrosine-phosphorylation site.	2
Our findings show that although c-Src activity is dispensable for VEGFR-2-dependent tube formation of endothelial cells, its activity is highly critical for VEGF-stimulated endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis in chorioallantoic membrane model of angiogenesis.	1
Consistently, subcellular localization experiments showed that the amount of HS1 in the nucleus is increased after B cell antigen receptor cross-linking (Fig. B).	1
The residual tyrosine phosphorylation by Src and FAK that were observed when GST-Rac1-Y64F was used as a phosphorylation substrate suggest the possibility of other tyrosine phosphorylation targets.	2
Those spots that showed hemorrhagic complication were excluded from further evaluation in the follow-up study.	1
Therefore, out results highly suggested that STAT1 activation is mainly resulted from phosphorylation at Tyr701 and Ser727 other than the expression regulation.	1
More recently, it was shown that the E3 ubiquitin-ligase activity of Smurf1 is stimulated by release of an autoinhibition between Smurf1-homodimers achieved upon APC/Cdh1 interaction.	1
These findings indicate that inhibition of phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase but promotion of phosphorylation of AMPK might contribute to the autophagy-inducing effect of danusertib in AGS and NCI-N78 cells.	3
As we saw no difference in the localization, activity or stability of S1466A Tiam1 compared with WT ( , ) we speculate that S1466 phosphorylation may be involved in a scaffolding function of Tiam1 at the centrosomes.	2
Furthermore, we show that inhibition of MEK/MAPK-signaling pathway prevents Ras-mediated activation of SAF-1.	1
Note that tyrosine phosphorylation of T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule after T cell activation was also observed in freshly prepared human T lymphocytes as well as in the Jurkat T cell line stimulated with biotinylated OKT-3 or anti-T Cell Receptor mAb C305 alone (not shown, and see Fig. ).	1

Finally, Src could interact with other signalling pathways, as it has been shown that it is capable of binding Shc, an early element of the Ras cascade leading to the activation of this pathway [ , ].	2
Endogenous TRAIL and death receptor 5 interaction leading to induction of apoptosis is recognized as a critical immunosurveillance mechanism against cancer cells. , Hence defective death receptor signaling is a mechanism that may favor immune evasion and survival of cancer cells.	2
The results in Figure suggest that this difference in mobility was not due to a difference in phosphorylation state of the LKB1 polypeptide.	2
Our 3D rBM studies demonstrate that, although CXCR4 expression in breast cancer cells induces expression of CXCR7, inhibition of CXCR7 with CCX771 in combination with inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, or CXCR4 did not result in less aggressive phenotype structures.	1
For control siRNA, the FRET ratios again showed that MEK1/2 inhibition promotes high Rac1 activity and low RhoA activity in lamellipodium-like protrusions (Figs and , ).	1
The western blotting results showed that nuclear kinase MSK1, when activated by TNF-α, specifically phosphorylated NF-κB p65 at the serine residue in position 276 (pSer276) and this phosphorylation was inhibited by Orf virus-encoded protein 002, or by the intact N-terminus of Orf virus-encoded protein 002 (002GM3 and 002GM4).	1

(A) OVCAR-4 and SKOV-3 cells were treated with 10 ng/ml FGF2 for 0 to 24 h as indicated, and then E-cadherin mRNA levels were analyzed by RT-qPCR. (B and C) OVCAR-4 and SKOV-3 cells were treated with different doses of FGF2 for 24 h after which E-cadherin mRNA levels (B) and protein levels (C) were analyzed by RT-qPCR and Western blotting, respectively.	1
Both PDK1 and PDK2 are dependent on 3'-phosphorylated membrane phosphatidylinositols for phosphorylation of AKT, and we previously showed that β1 integrins use the p110α phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase catalytic subunit for the generation of such phospholipids .	1
To further investigate the activation signals that might regulate Bam32 expression, resting B cells were stimulated in vitro with CD40 antibodies and Bam32 expression was determined.	3

We speculate that blocking the survival signals may be required for clinical responses to Raf inhibitors.	2
Together these observations indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation and Src activity are both required for PRL-3-dependent biological functions, and that Src regulation of PRL-3 may be part of an important signaling pathway contributing to tumor invasion and metastasis.	2
We have previously shown that estrogen receptorα associates with the AHR/ARNT complex to mediate estradiol-dependent transrepression of dioxin-inducible gene transcription .	1
We found that the basal activity level of phosphoinositide 3-kinase in the heat shock protein20-overexpressing HuH7 cells was significantly repressed compared with that in the empty vector-transfected cells ( ).	1
Previously, we demonstrated that the ability of Tiam1 to regulate centrosome separation and chromosome congression was dependent on its Rac GEF activity .	1
Recently, we reported that LKB1 is associated with two accessory proteins called Ste20-related adaptor protein-α (STRADα) [ ] and mouse protein 25-α [ ], for each of which there is also a closely related isoform (STRADβ and MO25β) encoded in the human genome.	2
Using zymography to test for active MMP-2 and MMP-9, we observed that MMP-2 is up-regulated in 2D cultures of MCF-7 CXCR4ΔCTD cells compared with MCF-7 parental cells (HT1080 is a control cell line; ).	1
These data suggest that PBR is the determining factor for the subcellular localization of RhoA and Rac1. (A) COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with expression constructs encoding GFP-RhoA, GFP-Rac1, GFP-Rac1-T108ERhoA-PBR, GFP-RhoA-S88E/T100ERac1-PBR, GFP-RhoARac1-PBR and GFP-Rac1RhoA-PBR.	2
Here, we show that overexpression of active H-Ras (H-RasG12R) in NIH3T3 fibroblasts impaired FGF2-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation, as compared to wild-type cells.	1
It also seems possible that only one active conformation exists that is greatly stabilized by membrane surface interaction.	2
We found that the primary phosphorylation site is not serine 112//S112 but serine 111//S111 , a site that is sometimes found phosphorylated in vivo.	2
Results using this updating scheme were in close agreement with the oscillations observed previously ( ), whereby the crucial RhoA dominance that has been observed experimentally remained present in all asynchronous simulations ( ) and all simulations showed some cyclic RhoA and Rac1 activity ( ).	1
Hence, it is reasonable to speculate that c-Cbl activity is not stringently required during development and the function of Cbl family proteins may be compensatory in their ability to regulate the activity of target proteins.	2
These data demonstrate that MEK inhibition prevents the establishment of actin-spike protrusions that form as a consequence of Rab-coupling protein-mediated trafficking of α5β1 and EGFR1, and suggest that in this context cells are unable to implement the Rac to RhoA switch in a physiologically relevant 3-D environment.	1
We showed that EGF stimulated RhoA activation and this activation was inhibited by U0126 ( ).	1
Neither ETP-45658 (nor PI-103) treatment significantly induced any known toxicity pathways (Figure A and B) suggesting that ETP-45658 treatment could be associated with a highly acceptable toxicity profile, particularly when compared to many chemotherapeutics in use today.Figure 2 Focused toxicity and safety assessment of ETP-45658. (A) Analysis of BioFunctions using Ingenuity Pathway Tox Analysis comparing ETP-45658 vs DMSO (sorted by P value where Y axis represents -log (P value). (B) Analysis of canonical pathways using Ingenuity Pathway Tox Analysis comparing ETP-45658 vs DMSO (sorted by P value). Y axis represents -log (P value). The line graph indicates the canonical pathway ratio (number of molecules in a given pathway that meet cut-off criteria, divided by total number of molecules that make up that pathway). None of the canonical pathways have been identified as significant suggesting little or no toxicity of treatment. Our data thus far indicates that ETP-45658 (as well as a PI-103) exerts its effect by inhibiting the cell cycle. However the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signalling pathway can also direct a plethora of other cellular functions and responses by the regulation of multiple transcription factors that includes Forkhead box O [ , ], p53 [ ], YAP [ ], NFkB [ ], CREB [ , ], c-MYC [ , ], and c-JUN [ ]. To address which transcription factor(s) directed the cellular response to ETP-45658 treatment, we carried out an enrichment analysis for transcription factor binding sites based on our genome-wide array data sets. Our studies identified binding sites for Forkhead box Os, E12, MAZ, LEF1 and NRF1, to be enriched and consistent with the toxicity analysis we conducted, we did not observe any binding site enrichment for p53, NFkB or c-JUN (Figure A). The significant accumulation of Forkhead box O-dependent genes led us to question if there was an equivalent enrichment of Forkhead box O-bound DNA motifs. A transcription factor enrichment analysis demonstrated that there was a highly significant increase of bound Forkhead box O sites (Figure B).	1
These results show that LKB1 acts as a tumor suppressor and that the catalytic activity of LKB1 is essential for this function, but the downstream substrate(s) that LKB1 phosphorylates to mediate the suppression of cell proliferation remained unknown.	1
Based on the present results, which showed nuclear factor-kappa B activation and accompanying increases of mot-2 during arsenite-induced neoplastic transformation, and the fact that the sequence GGAGGTTTCC of the mot-2 promoter is similar to kappaB DNA elements (GGGRNYYYCC) [see Supplemental Material, Figure 3A (doi:10.1289/ehp.0901677)], we investigated the possibility that the mot-2 increases were caused by nuclear factor-kappa B activation.	1
Thus, one might predict that a mutant of E3b1 unable to associate to Eps8 should function as a dominant negative on Ras-induced Rac-dependent ruffling.	3
Recently, we showed that Src-mediated phosphorylation of Ras promotes Raf displacement from Ras while enhancing GAP recruitment and subsequent GTP hydrolysis, thereby inactivating Ras .	1
"Furthermore, recent evidence indicates that early life chemical exposures may aberrantly ""reprogram"" gene expression patterns, thus resulting in altered growth responses and cancer later in life, as with diethylstilbestrol and uterine cancer ( )."	2
In that report, the pleckstrin homology domain of DAPP1 was found to bind in vitro to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase products PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2, consistent with our in vivo findings of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent membrane recruitment.	1
Data from at least three independent pull down assays are summarized in , which shows that inhibition of Src family kinases with SU6656 blocked PRL-3-induced RhoC activation, reducing it from 5-fold to basal levels.	1
The present study shows that FGF2 induced the down-regulation of E-cadherin expression, which is involved in FGF2-induced ovarian cancer cell invasion.	1
We note that 48 hours post exposure to ETP-45658 cells that did not express FOXO3a show a significantly higher S-phase cell population and that, in contrast to breast or osteosarcoma cells that express endogenous levels of FOXO3a, the absence of a potent cell cycle arrest phenotype (Figure D).	1
Thus, pathway; (c) activated JNK may have a distinct role to play when located in focal contacts that are complementary to or independent of its transcriptional role in the nucleus.	2
It has been reported that p21 Waf1/Cip1, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor regulated by p53, can bind to the CDK1/CDC2-cyclin B1 complex, thereby inducing cell cycle arrest. , The findings of the present study show that expression of p53, p27 Kip1, and p21 Waf1/Cip1 was increased in AGS and NCI-N78 cells treated with danusertib, which probably contributes to the inhibitory effect of danusertib on cell proliferation and inducing effect on cell cycle arrest.	2
We found that, when the cells were stimulated with EGF or EGF and collagen, IER3 protein was moderately expressed within 15 min ( ), suggesting that the protein expression started within a few minutes of stimulation.	2
As shown in , EGF treatment induced RhoA phosphorylation that can be detected by both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine antibodies.	2
These results suggest that ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT pathways are involved in the BMP9 mediated proliferation and metastasis of SK-BR-3 cells. (A) Effect of ERK1/2 inhibitor (PD98059) on the expression of ERK1/2 and phosphor-ERK1/2. (B) Effect of PI3K/AKT inhibitor (LY294002) on the expression of AKT and phosphor-AKT.	2
These preliminary data could indicate that T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule is involved in T Cell Receptor-mediated signal transduction pathways that do not converge at the level of the IL-2 gene.	3
As mentioned previously, there is now significant evidence suggesting that serine phosphorylation of p120 may contribute to its ability to negatively regulate the adhesive function of E-cadherin ( ; ) and several cellular treatments that eliminate the p120 band shift (e.g., staurosporine) also restore functional adhesion properties to the cadherin complex.	2
In contrast, our p120-uncoupled E-cadherin mutants localized properly to basolateral membranes in the absence of p120, indicating that p120 binding is not required for translocation and targeting of cadherins to regions of cell-cell contact.	1
However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the src homology 2 domain of Grb2 binds to one of the other tyrosine residues expressed in the intracytoplasmic tail of T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule, or that Grb2 binds to T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule via a sequence motif that does not involve its src homology 2 domain.	3
Taken together with the interaction results, we have demonstrated that a cancer derived mutation of B56γ3 may disrupt a physiologically significant function of PP2A in preventing tumor progression through activation of p53.	1
It has been shown that AMPK can further induce an effect on the RPS6K complex via mTOR in Non Small Cell Lung Cancer .	2
Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with anti-Gab1 antibodies followed by immunoblotting with anti-Shp2 antibodies demonstrates that wild type Gab1 forms a complex with Shp2 following EGF treatment, while the Gab1F627/659 mutant proteins fail to show an association with Shp2 thus confirming that phosphorylation of Tyr627 and 659 is required for Shp2 binding (Fig ).	1
In our recent study, we showed that HACE1 depletion had no effect on RhoA or CDC42 stability.	1
Recent studies have suggested that growth factor-induced membrane translocation and activation of AKT requires a protein scaffold provided by p21-activated kinase .	2
It is worth mentioning that several of the non-significant edges showed a high boostrap probability (e.g. WDR3 → RAF1).	1
We first examined the phosphorylation status of Akt and ERK upon treatment with 10 ng/ml FGF2 at 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes post-treatment and found that FGF2 treatment induced the phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) and ERK (Thr202/Tyr204) in a time-dependent manner in SKOV-3 cells ( ).	1
Following treatment with various mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors, the study showed that only a specific JNK inhibitor attenuated celecoxib-induced haeme oxygenase-1 expression, and kinase assays demonstrated increased phosphorylation and activation of c-JNK following {1800135=NSA} treatment [ ].	1
EGFP-Rac1WT or EGFP-Rac1-Y64F proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody and the membrane was blotted first with anti-GFP to demonstrate the expression level of EGFP-Rac1 proteins, and then with anti-Myc antibody to show the Myc-Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor that co-immunoprecipitated with EGFP-Rac1 proteins.	1
The pharmacological inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase , mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and MEK suggests that both phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt/mTOR and MAPK/ERK signaling are required for FGF2-induced E-cadherin down-regulation.	1
Further analysis ( ) showed that treatment with either olaparib or rucaparib significantly reduced liver kinase B1 expression (p<0.001).	1
A very recent paper showed that PI3K down-regulates E-cadherin expression through an increase in the expression of Slug and Twist transcription factors ( ).	1
Therefore, our data suggest that oncogenic Ras is able to induce a mesenchymal phenotype in epithelial MDCK cells by influencing the balance between Rac and Rho activity.	2
Indeed, we found that the combination of PLX4032 and AZD6244 functioned just as PLX4302 or AZD6244 alone did in decreasing death receptor 5 expression and protected cancer cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis ( ).	1
A possible explanation for such regulation may be consistent with that PAK1 can be activated through direct interaction with PI3K [ ] and can be indirectly activated by Akt [ ].	2
It is tempting to speculate that p53 could be generally required for the clearance of nonphysiological polyploid cells (syncytia or plasmodia).	3
These findings indicate that KLF5 loss enhances angiogenesis during prostatic carcinogenesis initiated by other oncogenic factors, and that enhanced angiogenesis could be a mechanism for the tumor promoting function of KLF5 loss.	2
Both approaches demonstrated that linker for activation of T cells expression levels in all of the infected Bone marrow-derived mast cells was about twofold higher than that in linker for activation of T cells+/+ Bone marrow-derived mast cells ( ).	1
We found that oncogenic Ras can directly repress CD24 mRNA, protein and promoter activity.	1
We also looked at the effect of PLX4032 on DR4 expression and found that PLX4032 did not decrease the levels of DR4 in the tested cell lines ( ), suggesting that PLX4032 primarily decreases the expression of death receptor 5, but not DR4.	2
Remarkably, we found that C-terminal deletion mutants of NDRG2 (ΔC and NDR), which do not interact with PP2A, are impaired in their ability to downregulate PTEN-Ser380/Thr382/Thr383 phosphorylation ( ).	1
Furthermore, MTT assay and invasion results indicated that HER2-mediated MEK/ERK induced cell proliferation and invasion via COX-2/AKT pathway.	1
The results indicate that upregulation of p53, p21 Waf1/Cip1, and p27 Kip1 expression by danusertib may result in arrest of G2 phase in AGS and NCI-N78 cell lines.	2
These data indicate that ASPP2 phosphorylation by RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase is necessary for ASPP2 full pro-apoptotic activity and this may be mediated by the stabilization of ASPP2 protein.	2
Recently, we found that Chibby promotes adipocyte and cardiomyocyte differentiation of pluripotent stem cells through inhibition of β-catenin signaling ( ; ).	1
It is therefore possible that the presence of activating mutations of SHP2 in Glioblastoma multiforme allows tumour progression by protecting cells from senescence and apoptosis.	2
Our data suggested that MEK/MAPK kinases in adenocarcinoma cells where as downstream kinases of PI3K and PLC including AKT/PKB, p70S6K and PKC in large cell carcinoma cells play key roles in regulating the protein phosphorylation events ( ).	2
Our recent study showed that interruption of KLF5 acetylation also promotes prostate cancer growth [ ].	1
To confirm these results, we performed p53 IP followed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody and showed that the QC mutant and B56α are indeed unable to interact with p53 ( , right).	1

RT-PCR and western blot assay showed that recombinant SK-BR-3/BMP9 and SK-BR-3/siBMP9 cells were well prepared for the subsequent experiments ( D).	1
The reduced inhibition of cell proliferation observed in the presence of the F395C mutant can be attributed to its p53-independent function as expression of the mutant in an isogenic p53 null background (HCT116 -/-) led to a decrease that showed no significant difference from wild type B56γ3 (p = 0.08) ( : ).	2
Others have shown that the rat sarcoma-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway is necessary for G1 progression and that it also regulates cyclin D1 transcription and p27 expression [ - ].	1
This observation was made in three different cell lines, MCF7 ( ), HeLa and GD25 (data not shown) using two different AKT2 antibodies (Abcam, ab66129 and Santa Cruz, sc-81436), suggesting that the shift in mobility, possibly caused by additional modifications of AKT2, is commonly occurring during its activation.	2
It was shown that endogenous RAS is necessary for the full apoptotic activity of ASPP2, which suggests that RAS signalling may modify ASPP2, potentially via a phosphorylation event.	2
Thus, our proof-of-concept studies underscore Medulloblastoma inhibitory properties of CARP-1 functional mimetics that could facilitate development of CARP-1 functional mimetics or their derivatives/analogs as potential anti-Medulloblastoma modalities.	3
This experiment showed that while less than 20% of cells expressing the WT protein or the p271-170, p27threonine 198E and p27threonine 198V were green, more than 50% of the colonies in cells expressing the p27threonine 198A protein were GFP-positive ( ), thus demonstrating that the overexpression of p27 in SCC9 cells was able to inhibit cell growth independently from phosphorylation of threonine 198//T198, but only when expressed over a threshold level.	1
Previous investigations have shown that these pathways are also activated by Ret9 and Ret51 ( ; ; ; ; ).	1
Previous studies have shown that these sequences are nuclease hypersensitive and capable of forming G4 quadruplex structure.	1
This work showed that both wild-type PTEN and PTEN Y138L were able to strongly suppress cellular proliferation, but with PTEN G129E mediating a weaker but still significant effect (Figures and ).	1
Since transactivation of wild-type RAF requires dimerization and depends on RAS activity, we hypothesized that the levels of RAS activity in BRAFV600E mutant tumors may not be sufficient to support transactivation.	3
We also confirmed that these inhibitors induced mild or moderate poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage in NCI-H929 and RPMI-8226 cells ( ).	1
Further studies will be required to decipher the precise role of p110β in the development of fibrosis in the lung and potentially other organ systems, and to learn whether a similar mechanism exists to recruit fibroblasts to sites of primary tumors and metastases, processes that could then be targeted by isoform-specific p110β inhibitors or strategies specifically disrupting the Dock180/Elmo1-RAC-p110β signaling axis.	2
It is important to note that this activation occurs with endogenous protein levels of the signal transduction pathway, in non-cancerous, non-transformed cells, using modest doses of TGF-β (2 ng/ml), demonstrating this is a normal response and not related to over-expression artifacts or cancer induced mutations.	1
Variants that result in deletions of the C-terminal sequence show enhanced transforming activity ( ) and are expressed in increased amounts in gastric, bladder, and stomach cancer cell lines ( , ; ; ) and in a majority of human breast carcinoma cells ( ).	1

In this study, our results demonstrated for the first time that HER2 elevated COX-2 expression through the activation of MEK/ERK pathway, which subsequently induced cell proliferation and invasion via AKT pathway in non-small-cell lung cancer tissues.	1
Because the intensity correlation quotient data in confluent ECs were derived using overexpressed c-Abl, the possibility remains that colocalization of endogenous c-Abl and F-actin may differ somewhat in confluent cells compared with the subconfluent ECs shown in .	2
We now report that both recruitment of Cas to the Proline-rich region 1 region of FAK located in focal adhesion sites and phosphorylation of Cas are required to support survival.	1
To confirm that ERK was responsible for MED14 phosphorylation, we used mutants of the Ras/ERK cascade.	1
These studies demonstrated that pp60src-mediated nmMLCK phosphorylation at Y464 and Y471 results in a threefold increase in myosin light chain kinase enzymatic activity ( ).	1
These surprising results were coupled with the observation that 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-induced repression of estrogen receptor-signaling is maintained in both cell lines after ARNT knockdown ( and ) thus providing evidence that ARNT is not required for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin/aryl hydrocarbon receptor-dependent repression of estrogen receptorα signaling.	1
Having demonstrated that dephosphorylation of FGFR2 by Shp2 is impeded in the presence of Grb2, we investigated whether Grb2 was inhibiting the formation of a direct equilibrium complex between the receptor and phosphatase.	1
In this study, we report that FGF2 treatment down-regulated E-cadherin by up-regulating its transcriptional repressors, Slug and ZEB1, in human ovarian cancer cells.	1
Similar results were also reported in a previous study, which showed that myricetin inhibits acrylamide-induced COX-2 expression by blocking activation of the MEK/ERK pathway.	1
Similarly, our results showed that Rac1 Q61L increased hypoxia-inducible factor-1α protein expression in MCF-7 cells while preventing Rac1 activity by Rac1 T17N and siRNA Rac1 increased the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α protein and VEGF mRNA reduction under hypoxia, suggesting that hypoxia-induced Rac1 activity was responsible for the expression and activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α in breast cancer cells.	1
In conclusion, our data show that two pools of Sos-1 exist in the cell, coupled respectively to Grb2 or E3b1.	1
Analysis of cell lysates collected pre- and post-treatment showed that phosphorylation (activation) of proteins in the PI3K/mTOR pathway was increased in treated cell lines.	1
Consistent with its reduced binding capability to E1052, the result showed that E1052 only partially reduces the ability of VEGFR-2 to phosphorylate c-Src ( ).	2
We show here that elevated FAM83B expression also activates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and confers a decreased sensitivity to PI3K, AKT, and mTOR inhibitors.	1
In addition, we demonstrated that P-REX1 activates IGF-1R/InsR, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT, and MEK/ERK signaling in breast cancer cells in a Rac activation-dependent manner ( - , ).	1
We found that there was a significant repression of the promoter activity in the RasV12 cells.	1
These results strongly suggest that the predominant localization of p120 at adherens junctions requires functional junction-forming cadherins, and that high levels of cytoplasmic p120 indicate the absence or malfunction of such cadherins.	1
We also saw moderately reduced proliferation of p110β-RAS-binding domain-DM primary Mouse embryonic fibroblasts, indicating that p110β regulation through its RAS-binding domain interactors is essential for normal cell proliferation, which appears to contradict findings from p110β kinase-dead knock in mice Mouse embryonic fibroblasts and reconstituted p110β-KO Mouse embryonic fibroblasts suggesting that p110β lipid kinase activity is not required for proliferation. ( ; ).	2
Further analysis of the BKM-120 sensitivity data revealed that cell lines with a known MYC amplification had a significantly lower IC50 (p = 0.01, ), validating the proteomic marker.	1
Mutation of Y126//Y126 reduced overall phosphorylation marginally, indicating that this residue can be phosphorylated but is not the preferred site.	2
Since Cdc42-Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor interactions are involved in Cdc42-induced cellular transformation, it was suggested that phosphorylation of Cdc42 led to alteration of its targeting via Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor.	2
Moreover we examined the effects of PLX4032 and AZD6244 at sub-micromolar concentrations on death receptor 5 expression and found that both agents at 0.25 μM and 0.5 μM effectively reduced the levels of p-ERK1/2 and death receptor 5 ( ), indicating that these agents at low concentration ranges also suppress death receptor 5 expression.	1
We showed above that the interaction between RhoA and ERK is mediated by RhoA docking site ( ).	1
Complementary to these findings, it was later shown that Smurf1 also controls the degradation of RhoA for disruption of tight junctions during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition promoted by TGF-β in mammary gland epithelial cells.	1
It is speculated that transient activation of Ras by growth factor signaling may induce MKP3 expression through an Erk1/2-dependent Ets-family transcription factor, but sustained activation of Ras may preferentially use the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent pathway to induce MKP3 expression.	2
With respect to surface protein levels, we found that CD24 expression was downregulated by all the Ras effector mutants, including RasV12G37, when compared to control cells.	1
Since inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase extended the duration of Smad2/3 activation rather than altering their initial response to AA, we reasoned that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signalling might affect Smad2/3 activity by regulating its turnover, either via phosphatase-mediated dephosphorylation of the SxS motif or by ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of the active Smad2/3 protein .	3
These data suggest that B cell antigen receptor cross-linking causes a significant fraction of tyrosine-phosphorylated HS1 to localize to the nucleus.	2
Deletion of the serine-proline-rich domain from MED14 (MED14Δ) generated a mutant that no longer accumulated in the nucleus (unpublished), hence its exclusion from functional assays, suggesting that the serine-proline-rich domain might be required for MED14 incorporation into Mediator.	3
We previously demonstrated that activated B-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling positively regulates death receptor 5 expression.	1
It has been shown previously that Rac1 PBR (PVKKRKRK), containing a nuclear localization signal , promotes the accumulation of Rac1 in the nucleus, whereas RhoA PBR (RRGKKKSG), without an nuclear localization signal, sequesters RhoA in the cytosol [ ].	1
This finding is particularly important because, for example, a large number of FGFR2 mutations in melanoma are described as loss-of-function ( ), yet our data suggest that this apparent loss-of-function could still be oncogenic due to the mutation leading to the loss of receptor regulation by Grb2.	3
First, we showed that IER3 expression started within a few minutes after stimulation.	1
Only a long exposure of the film detected a weak phosphorylation of Y1173//Y1173 (data not shown), suggesting that in addition to Src kinases, VEGFR-2 itself also catalyzes phosphorylation of Y1173 of VEGFR-2.	2
These results suggested that RARα might play an important role in the combination treatment.	3
Upon sequence analysis, we observed that Ret9, but not Ret51, harbors a putative PDZ-binding motif (FTRF) at the very COOH terminus ( a).	1
In addition, the identification of a large number of SYNJ2 binding partners strongly suggests that, in addition to regulating phosphatidylinositol metabolism, SYNJ2 may function as a scaffold to coordinate signaling events that regulate clathrin mediated endocytosis and the formation of podosomes and invadopodia.	2
In addition, conventional comparative genomic hybridization studies indicate that deletion spanning the KLF5 locus could occur in as much as 39% of prostate cancers [ ], and our earlier deletion analyses suggest that hemizygous deletion is more common than homozygous deletion in prostate cancer [ , ].	3
We showed previously that the N-termini of ASPP1 and ASPP2 are required for full enhancement of p53 activity.	1
Furthermore, RT-PCR indicated that BMP9 inhibited the HER2 expression by suppressing the transcription of HER2 gene in SK-BR-3 cells ( ).

Our model suggests that transactivation will be dependent on formation of RAF dimers.	2
Together these data show that constitutively active Ras significantly downregulates CD24 at both the mRNA and surface protein expression levels.	1
Since Bam32 binds the same phospholipid as Btk and associates with phospholipase Cγ2, it is tempting to speculate that Bam32 could regulate the activation of phospholipase Cγ2 by Btk.	3
In our present study, it is noteworthy that a direct physical association between RhoA and ERK can be found both in the COS-7 cell line and in SKBR3, a breast cell line.	2
These data demonstrated and confirmed that p85 was specifically phosphorylated on serine 83//S83 by PKA.	1
It has been shown that Lyn activates Syk when they are coexpressed in fibroblasts ( ) and that B cell antigen receptor cross-linking induces little activation of Syk in the splenic B cells (Nishizumi, H., unpublished data) and mast cells ( ) of lyn-/- mice.	1
Furthermore, significant single locus associations as well as haplotype analyses in Caucasian and African-American subjects confirmed that MYLK (the gene encoding MLCK) is an attractive candidate gene in sepsis- ( ) and trauma-associated ALI ( ) and severe asthma ( ), with the nmMLCK-unique coding SNPs dependent on the racial composition of the ALI cohort (African descent vs. European descent).	1
These results suggest that endogenous p53-R273H contact mutant is mediating the survival of breast cancer cells by suppressing the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.	2
Altogether these data confirm that threonine 198//T198 is a key residue for p27 protein stability and its effect is not dependent on the phosphorylation of Threonine 187//T187.	1
We have shown that the hotspot mutant E545K belongs to this class, in accordance with previous work ( ; ).	1
The biological significance of E-cadherin reduction in ovarian cancer invasiveness was demonstrated by the fact that overexpression of E-cadherin blocked FGF2-induced cell invasion in vitro.	1
Significantly, while this paper was in preparation, have demonstrated that uPAR expression leads to the activation of β3 integrins in the murine kidney ( ).	1
The small amount of activity remaining in the supernatants of the AMP-activated protein kinase kinase1 and AMP-activated protein kinase kinase2 immunoprecipitates could be accounted for by the fact that the immunoprecipitation was not quantitative, with a small amount of the LKB1 polypeptide remaining in the supernatant.	3
Another explanation for the different size of the effect in cell-free assays and intact cells is that other sites in the ST loop may be phosphorylated in the intact cells, a possibility discussed further below.	2
These data demonstrate that signaling by the Ret9 isoform is sufficient to induce epithelial tube formation, and that this activity depends on an intact PDZ-binding motif on Ret.	1
These data underscore pleiotropic nature of apoptosis signaling by CARP-1 functional mimetics, and suggest that combined activation of p38 and JNK likely amplify the apoptosis signals in the Medulloblastoma cells independent of the involvement of the cell surface NTR and Trk receptors.	2
In our previous work to identify the Crk SH3 binding partners essential for transformation of NIH3T3 cells by CrkI, we found that the activity of Abl family kinases antagonized the transforming activity of Crk ( ).	1
These results suggest that BMP9 strongly suppresses the proliferation of SK-BR-3 cells. (A) MTT assay showed BMP9 suppressed the viability of SK-BR-3 cells. Colony formation assay showed BMP9 inhibited the colony formation ability of SK-BR-3 cells (×100). (D, E) Wound-closure assay showed BMP9 inhibited the migration of SK-BR-3 cells (×100). (F, G) Transwell invasion assay showed that BMP9 inhibited the invasion of SK-BR-3 cells (×100).	1
We propose that other tumors that possess somatic autoactivating mutations or amplification in non-receptor tyrosine kinases could use similar mechanisms for AKT activation .	1
Kanellis et al. demonstrated that acute activation of JNK signalling occurs following ischaemia/reperfusion, with higher JNK activation detected in deceased donor compared to live donor allografts, thus suggesting that increased JNK reflects greater ischaemic damage [ ].	1
During our studies on Ras-mediated SAF-1 induction, we have observed that once activated, SAF-1 acts as a transcriptional inducer of H-Ras and K-Ras and we reveal the presence of a transactivation loop in which oncogenic Ras increases DNA-binding and transcriptional activities of SAF-1 which in turn, increases transcription of Ras forming a feed-forward regulatory pathway.	1
Together, these data suggest that ASPP2 colocalises with RAS and facilitates the membrane localisation of RAS in human cancer cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts.	2
The inferred network presented some interesting relations among genes that have been discussed in literature: PRKAA1 (AMPK Subunit α) was found as one of the major upstream regulators of the inferred network.	1
However, (B) confirms that BRSK1 was not phosphorylated by CaMKKβ, even in the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin. (A) Activity of GST-AMPK-α1, -BRSK1 or -BRSK2 after incubation in the presence of MgATP for 1 h with or without CaMKKβ (minus Ca2+/calmodulin), or LKB1:STRADα:MO25α. (B) Time course of phosphorylation of GST-BRSK1 by CaMKKβ plus Ca2+/calmodulin, or LKB1:STRADα:MO25α. (C) Activity of AMPK-α1 and BRSK1 after incubation in the presence of MgATP for 1 h with or without CaMKKα plus Ca2+/calmodulin, or LKB1:STRADα:MO25α. (D) Time course of phosphorylation of GST-BRSK1 in the experiment shown in (C).	1
The so far-described protein-protein interactions suggest that Shanks act mainly as dynamic cytoskeletal adaptors in neurons and do not play an active role in signal transduction.	2
Our results collectively suggest that the association between T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule and p85 is direct and involves the tyrosine-phosphorylated YxxM motif of T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule and the src homology 2 domains of p85.	2
Then real-time RT-PCR showed that expression of caspase-3, caspase-9 and Bax in SGC7901 were upregulated at mRNA level and Bcl-2 was downregulated at mRNA level after exposure to fangchinoline ( ).	1
An analysis looking at each dose of BKM-120 individually ( ) showed that the vast majority of cell lines had greater-than-additive responses (>10% greater than predicted additive response as described for ) were at the lowest dose of BKM-120 (at which BKM-120 would have the fewest off-target effects).	2
Our data suggest that MAPK/ERK is an upstream factor of ZEB1 activation in ovarian cancer cells in vitro.	2
We also confirm that the signals required for activation of Net1 (and RhoA) are generated in the nucleus, as isolated nuclei exposed to ionizing radiation also show this effect ( ).	1
Consistent with this loss of FOXO3a phosphorylation, we also observed the significant accumulation of nuclear FOXO3a and that these responses were conserved in a range of in vitro cancer models, including MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 breast cancer cell line models.	1
D, superposition of the SHP-2 N SH2 domain in the presence (green, PDB code 1AYA) and absence (red, PDB code 2SHP) of phosphotyrosine ligand (black) indicates that Ser/Thr at the N-terminal cap of helix αB is not highly dynamic.	1
Recently, Yin et al. showed that MED23-/- Murine Embryonic Fibroblasts were predestined to a smooth muscle cell phenotype, concluding that the absence of MED23 allowed Myocardin-like factors to predominate over TCFs at common target gene promoters ( ).	2
We have shown that uPAR and β3 integrin are required for Rac activation in tumor cells cultured on vitronectin or in the presence of serum, which is an abundant source of vitronectin with concentrations in the range of 200 to 400 μg/ml ( ).	1
Although E-cadherin loss is generally an epigenetic event that occurs late in tumorigenesis, mutations or deletions in the gene itself are common in lobular carcinoma of the breast ( ) and in gastric tumors ( ), suggesting that in some instances E-cadherin loss may be an early, if not causal event.	2
We found that the binding between ERK5 and ERK1/2 was indirect, and we did not determine whether ERK5 Thr732 phosphorylation by ERK1/2 was direct or indirect using in vitro kinase assay.	1
In summary, our results show that FGF2 down-regulates E-cadherin expression, most likely through the transcriptional suppression of Slug and ZEB1, which are concomitantly expressed by the activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt/mTOR and MAPK/ERK pathways.	1
This latter result also suggests that MKK7, another potential MAP kinase kinase that activates p38 MAPK, does not play a role in this survival pathway.	2
Together, our analyses suggest that a subset of the SRC-dependent substrates we identified downstream of CSF-1R induced SRC activation are relevant in human epithelial tumorigenesis.	2
Although they do not have obvious mammalian homologs, they are related to LKB1, a tumor suppressor that is mutated in the human Peutz-Jeghers cancer syndrome.	1
We also found that inhibiting TDRG1 expression via RNA interference dramatically attenuates the ability of testicular germ cell tumor NTERA-2 cells to proliferate and invade.	1
We have previously found (unpublished observations) that, although AMP-activated protein kinase is expressed in HeLa cells, it is not activated either by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside or by metformin.	1
If the LKB1-AMPK pathway acts as a tumour suppressor, one might expect many tumour cells to have been selected for mechanisms that down-regulate it.	3
Although the precise significance of this spatially-defined interaction is unknown, our work has demonstrated that the cortactin SH3 domain interaction with nmMLCK is required for the peripheral myosin light chain phosphorylation induced by sphingosine 1-phosphate ( ).	1
Overall, our results show that HER2 alters autophosphorylation patterns of the EGFR and of itself, favoring Gab1, p85 (PI3K) and SHP2, and disfavoring c-Cbl and Grb2 interactions.	1
To confirm that the Shank-Ret9 interaction is direct, we performed a PDZ class switch experiment ( ) by introducing compensatory mutations in Shank3 and Ret9.	1
In conclusion, we show here that the complex regulation of p27 functions include not only the phosphorylation of Threonine 198//T198 but also the three dimensional conformation of its unstable C-terminal tail and how these events eventually play a role in the control of ECM-driven cell motility.	1
The result showed that VEGFR-2 associates with Src homology 2-Src in VEGF-dependent manner and mutation of Y1057 inhibited association of VEGFR-2 with c-Src ( ).	1
Thus, our data suggest that sphingosine 1-phosphate induces colocalization of c-Abl with peripheral F-actin but not with intercellular adherens junction during EC barrier enhancement.	2
It is important to note that the c-Abl kinase was not removed from the nmMLCK preparation before its addition to the actin polymerization assay because both the c-Abl kinase and the nmMLCK protein are labeled with His tags.	1
Lesions that activate RAS or, as recently reported, overexpression of wild type RAF isoforms could result in inability of RAF inhibitors to suppress ERK signaling in the tumor and thus lead to resistance.	3
Although correlations between CXCR4 expression and metastasis were established ( ; ), the mechanism by which CXCR4 signaling effects both morphological and behavioral changes that are fundamental to breast cancer invasion and metastasis has not been characterized.	1
The NH2-terminal domain also contains a region with a significant homology to band 4.1 ( ) that may interact directly or indirectly with the cytoplasmic domains of integrin β subunits ( ).	2
The amount of Grb2 associated with linker for activation of T cells-1YF was actually higher than that observed with the linker for activation of T cells-WT and Grb2 association.	1
Previous studies have shown that upon the introduction of Ras oncogene, MCF-10A cells undergo transformation and these transformed cells exhibit hall marks of transformation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition , including anchorage-independent growth, loss of requirement of hormones, invasiveness, and tumorigenicity in nude mice , .	1
Consistent with this idea, our data indicate that basal levels of PI(3,4,5)P3 may be sufficient for some Bam32 to associate with the plasma membrane so that Bam32 is at the membrane before B cell antigen receptor activation.	2
We show that NDRG2 is a PTEN-binding protein that recruits protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) to PTEN.	1
Previous work in other systems shows that integrin signaling recruits DOCK180 to the plasma membrane via the formation of a p130Cas-Crk-DOCK180 complex.	1
We find that mutation of the p110β RAS-binding domain strongly attenuates p110β activation downstream of G-protein-coupled receptors, highlighting the importance of the RAS-binding domain for p110β key signaling functions.	1
The x-ray crystallographic structure of the EGFR ectodomain shows that the dimerization arm is autoinhibited in the resting state by intramolecular interaction between domains 2 and 4, but EGF binding induces conformational changes that relieve the dimerization arm, leading to homo- or heterodimerization ( - ).	1
Taken together, our study demonstrated that hypoxia-induced HIF-1α expression involves a cascade of signaling events including reactive oxygen species generation, activation of PI3K and ERK signaling, and subsequent activation of Rac1.	1
The inability of HRas to interact with Ca2+/calmodulin could be due to the absence of a polybasic region and (or) the presence of additional palmitoyl modifications that are unlikely to fit in the Ca2+/calmodulin hydrophobic pocket.	3
The result showed that although its ubiquitination requires c-Cbl, degradation of PLCγ1 is not regulated by c-Cbl ( ).	1
Another new result in this article is that STRADα protein (unlike mouse protein 25-α) was not detectable in HeLa cells unless either wild-type or kinase-dead LKB1 was stably expressed (Figure ).	1
GST-Ack1 bound to purified AKT and androgen receptor but not the Y176F mutant of AKT suggesting that AKT and androgen receptor are direct binding partners of Ack1 ( ).	2
Finally, we show that activity-dependent translocation of KRas may serve as a way to quickly and selectively carry persistent KRas activity to intracellular membranes, providing a regulatory mechanism that allows differential control of the spatial and temporal activity patterns of KRas and HRas.	2
In conclusion, we demonstrate a new cross-talk mechanism between ERK5 and ERK1/2 in which phosphorylation of ERK5 at Thr732 is induced by ERK1/2, and showed that this phosphorylation event is required for ERK5 nuclear localization and MEF2C activation.	1
Since MKK4 is the upstream activator of JNK1/2, these data suggest that the activation of JNK is a central event in the transmission of survival signals downstream of fibronectin and FAK when serum is absent.	2
The results demonstrate that the four distal tyrosines are the major phosphorylation sites of linker for activation of T cells in mast cells.	1
These findings are consistent with the experiments of , which demonstrated by mutational analysis that the phosphotyrosine binding domain of Shc transduces migratory signals while the SH2 domain is required for mitogenesis.	1
Therefore it is provocative to speculate that our findings may have a positive impact on the clinical efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.	2
The result shows that Src homology 2 domain of Src also directly interacts with phosphorylated Y1057 in a c-Cbl independent manner ( ), suggesting that the interaction of c-Src with Y1057 of VEGFR-2 is established by a direct binding involving its Src homology 2 domain and an indirect interaction involving c-Cbl. summarizes our observation regarding interaction of c-Src with VEGFR-2 and role of c-Cbl in this process.	2
To provide further evidence that ASPP1 and ASPP2 preferentially interact with RAS-GTP, a p53-null osteosarcoma cell line Saos2 was starved for 20 h and then stimulated with 20% foetal calf serum and EGF.	2
We observed that lung cancer cell lines harboring HRAS mutations showed significant higher sensitivity to MEK inhibitors than HRAS wild-type cell lines.	1
The activity of the PTEN-related phosphatase, TPIP, towards lipids but not the tested peptide substrate indicates that the protein phosphatase activity of PTEN is not a necessary but inconsequential by-product of a PTP phosphatase domain with a large basic active site capable of accommodating PtdInsP3.	1
Here we show that CXCR4WT (wild type) or CXCR4∆CTD in poorly metastatic MCF-7 cells results in 1) up-regulation of genes and signaling pathways important in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; 2) up-regulation of factors involved in cell migration, including CXCR2 and its ligands, as well as CXCR7; and 3) secretion of cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), CCL2, and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which are important in tumor metastasis.	1
Furthermore, enhanced TGF-β-induced transcriptional responses that were observed in PP5-null mice has been shown to result from increased levels of Smad3 protein rather than through any direct effect upon the duration of their activation .	1
We further observed that long-term suppression of PARP1 expression by gene knockdown also resulted in increased PI3K/mTOR signaling.	1
Our studies showed that even in the presence of Phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase inhibitor, ligand bound HER2/ErbB-2 or EGFR activated Ack1 which in turn Tyr-phosphorylated and activated AKT.	1
Previous evidence suggests that this mechanism also operates in human hepatoma (Huh-7) cells infected with the hepatitis C virus [ ], where PI3K is activated due to association with a non-structural protein encoded by the viral RNA [ ].	2
These data indicated that 14-3-3ζ formed a complex with phosphoinositide 3-kinase and recruited phosphoinositide 3-kinase to the cell membrane where phosphoinositide 3-kinase became activated. 14-3-3 association with target proteins usually occurs through a 14-3-3 consensus binding motif centered around a phosphorylated serine residue on the target protein.	1
These results show that Tiam1 is phosphorylated by Cdk1 on S1466, and the phosphorylated pool of Tiam1 is present on centrosomes in early mitosis.	1
In that context, AMPK activation has been recently suggested as a possible way to sensitize cells to erlotinib .	2
This result demonstrates that Gab2 overexpression suppresses E-cadherin expression in ovarian cancer cells.	1
We therefore hypothesized that TAS-116 could enhance mitochondrial damage-induced apoptosis induced by rat sarcoma-RAF-MEK-ERK inhibitors.	3
In addition to the canonical GTPase cycle, recent findings have suggested that phosphorylation further contributes to the tight regulation of Rho GTPases.	2
Our analysis showed that mutation of Y1052//Y1052 had no apparent effect on the ability of CKR to promote tube formation of PAE cells.	1
We determined that Grb2 is not complexed indirectly with Ret9 through Shc, because Shank3-Pro2 still binds Grb2 when the Shc-binding-deficient Ret9 Y1062F mutant is coexpressed ( , a and b).	1
Using BAD peptides (aa 105-118), we found that activated Raf-1 enhanced Pak1 phosphorylation of BAD ( Lane 1 and 2).	1
McCright et al. reported that B56α1 and B56β1 are localized in cytoplasm, and that B56γ1 is concentrated in nuclei.	1
Indeed, the presence of weak but detectable PRL-3 tyrosine phosphorylation in SYF cells ( ) suggests that kinases other than Src, Yes or Fyn can also play this role to some extent.	2
The data show that stimulation of endothelial cells with VEGF promotes phosphorylation of b-Raf at Ser 455 and silencing expression of IQGAP1 notably reduced its phosphorylation ( ).	1
We recently showed that tyrosyl phosphorylation of Ras promotes binding to RasGAP and GTP hydrolysis .	1
These results are consistent with the results in and , showing that Ser491//S491 on α2 is modified by autophosphorylation, and not by Akt as for Ser487 on α1.	1
Since we observed that CD24 mRNA and protein expression are downregulated by Ras, we next asked which pathways downstream of Ras are sufficient to suppress CD24 expression.	1
Although phosphoinositide 3-kinase is not required to activate RAC, it is still essential for fibroblast migration in gradients of lysophosphatidic acid, indicating that PIP3-regulated pathways distinct from RAC activation contribute to G-protein-coupled receptor-driven chemotaxis.	1
Collectively, these findings suggest that the binding of Rac1-guanosine 5'-triphosphate to HACE1 stimulates its ubiquitin-ligase activity.	2
Our results suggest that PRL-3 may mediate some tumorigenic functions of Src, particularly those associated with control of small GTPases, such as RhoC, and tumor cell motility and invasion.	2
Tyrosine phosphorylation on HS1 may trigger its conformational alteration that allows its nuclear translocation and thereby signaling to its downstream targets.	2
These data indicated that the phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is regulated by TDRG1.	1
Furthermore it appears that distinct Eph receptors can transmit opposite signals to the MAPK pathways through their ability to engage distinct targets; thus, the variation between systems may well reflect receptor cross-talk and/or different feedback loops.	2
The assay showed that the migration of tCalu1-B56γ1 cells was significantly lower than that of tCalu1-mock cells ( ).	1
Despite the contrasting effects of phenformin and 2-deoxyglucose on cellular ADP/ATP ratios, the results in confirm that, under appropriate conditions, both agents are capable of activating AMPK, even in cells completely lacking LKB1. (A) HeLa cells were treated with or without 3 μM A23187 in the presence and absence of 10 mM phenformin or 100 μM 2-deoxyglucose for 1 h.	1
To explain the first point we infer that the MED23 antibody immunoprecipitates a pool of free MED23 but is unable to recognize MED23 associated with Mediator.	1
The combined data suggest that inactivation of PP2A-B56γ1 prior to the initiation of MEK and ERK phosphorylation could be involved in transmission of the signal from MEK to ERK.	3
Both RhoA and Rac1 contain the putative docking site at their C-termini, and these ERK-docking sites mediate the interaction between ERK and both RhoA and Rac1 ( , [ ]. Although a P is missing at the -2 or -3 position of both S88 and T100, RhoA was more strongly phosphorylated by active ERK than Rac1. A possible explanation for this result is that RhoA contains multiple ERK phosphorylation sites including S88 and T100, but Rac1 only contains one site, T108. Indeed, mutation of both S88 and T100 simultaneously decreased RhoA phosphorylation much more than the mutation of either one of them ( ). We also showed that Cdc42 is only marginally phosphorylated by active ERK ( ). Although it has two PXTP motifs, Cdc42 does not have a strong docking site, which may explain its weak phosphorylation by ERK. Our study is the first to demonstrate the direct interaction between ERK and RhoA, and that this interaction is dependent on the docking site of RhoA ( ). We also showed that ERK can directly phosphorylate RhoA ( ), RhoA phosphorylation is dependent on the activation of ERK in cells ( ) and RhoA phosphorylation regulated RhoA activity ( ). A body of evidence has shown that ERK and RhoA signaling pathways are closely linked. However, all of these studies examined the interaction between ERK and RhoA regulators, and the data are controversial. Some studies have shown that ERK enhances the activation of RhoA to regulate the actin assembly through phosphorylation of GEF-H1, a RhoA GDP/GTP exchange factor [ ]. TNF-α-induced RhoA activation is mediated by ERK stimulation of GEF-H1 [ ]. In contrast, another study has suggested that the phosphorylation of GEF-H1 by ERK inhibits GEF-H1 activity, which decreases RhoA activation [ ]. This study further showed that the inhibition of ERK activity led to increased RhoA activation in certain Ras mutant cell lines [ ]. Conversely, a different study has suggested that RhoA activation substantially prolongs the duration of ERK activation at both normal and reduced Ras levels [ ].	1
We employed dual standard enrichment analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (as described in our Materials and methods section) identifying the cell cycle and cell cycle-related processes to be highly enriched in differentially regulated genes following ETP-45658 treatment (Figure S3A, 3B in Additional file and Table S2 in Additional file ) suggesting that the cell cycle is the biological process that is the most affected after exposure to ETP-45658, a result that is supported by our FACS analysis shown previously.	2
As shown in , the number of TCam-2 cells that passed through the Transwell membrane decreased to ~30% of the number of control cells that passed through the membrane after LY294002-mediated inhibition of phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Akt/mTOR signaling (P<0.01).	1
As a further control, we employed normal HeLa cells as an LKB1-null cell line, as it is known that LKB1 is not expressed in these cells [ ].	1
This latter result strongly suggests that an intact Sos-1-E3b1-Eps8 complex is required for binding to Rac, providing a molecular basis for the catalytic specificity of the complex.	2
Shank proteins, initially also described as ProSAP proteins, are scaffolding adaptors that have been previously shown to integrate neurotransmitter receptors into the cortical cytoskeleton at postsynaptic densities.	1
Interestingly, B cell antigen receptor ligation alone does not significantly affect Bam32 expression, and does not affect upregulation when used in combination with CD40 ligation, suggesting that transcription of Bam32 is specifically CD40 responsive.	2
However, it is interesting to note that, consistent with our results ( ), ectopic expression of 14-3-3ζ was found to cause the cytoplasmic enrichment of β-catenin ( ), potentially by interacting with endogenous Chibby.	1
Cleaved PARP was also increased following treatment with BKM-120 (p = 0.01), suggesting that, unlike with the PARP inhibitor, which is believed to elicit a majority of its cytotoxic effect through PARP trapping [ ], BKM-120 kills Small cell lung cancer cells through apoptosis, which has been reported elsewhere as the primary mode of cell killing by BKM-120 [ ].	3
Additional experiments showed that accumulation of hypoxia inducible factor 1α induced by KLF5 loss depended on the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.	1
This showed that PTEN Y138L 354stop still lacked activity against PolyGluTyr-P and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, whilst retaining lipid phosphatase activity ( ).	1
We note that our mapping data are at variance with those recently reported by , who concluded that, in vivo, the interaction between Sos-1 and E3b1-Abi-1 is mediated by the NH2-terminal portion of the latter.	1
Concentrations of BYL719 that have been shown to inhibit the other p110 isoforms [ ] also downregulated mTOR activity (Fig. ).	1
These data strongly suggest that Grb2 constitutively inhibits the ability of Shp2 to dephosphorylate the receptor.	2
Our experimental conditions do not exclude the possibility that RhoA and Net1 are activated in the cytoplasm and shuttled into the nucleus during the assay.	2
In contrast, no apoptotic effects were observed in MCF-7 cells that express wild-type p53, nor in SKBR3 cells that express p53-R175H conformational mutant ( and ).	1
The conformation of Mediator differs between forms bound to CDK8 and RNA polymerase II ( ) and it has been shown to undergo structural shifts triggered by interactions with the transactivation domain of p53 that correlated with RNA polymerase II activation ( ).	1
Specific interactions in vitro and in vivo indicated that Rac1 may be a substrate for the non-receptor tyrosine kinases FAK and Src.	2
These findings suggest that endogenous HRAS and KRAS are required for the full activities of ASPP1 and ASPP2.	2
Expression of wild-type LKB1, but not catalytically inactive LKB1 or Peutz-Jeghers syndrome mutants, in G361 cells caused a G1-phase cell-cycle arrest [ ] that was associated with the induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21, and was dependent on p53 [ ].	1
Although we cannot rule out the possibility that AMP-activated protein kinase kinase1 and/or AMP-activated protein kinase kinase2 contain additional associated protein(s) other than LKB1, STRADα/β and mouse protein 25-α/β, it is also possible that differences in covalent modification might affect the shape of the complex and hence the Stokes radius.	3
The viability of U87 and A172 cells transfected with non-targeting siRNA was not significantly different to that of untransfected or mock-transfected cells (data not shown).	1
It has been reported recently that Ser491//S491 on AMPK-α2 can be phosphorylated by S6K1 [ ], so we considered the possibility that Ser487 might have been phosphorylated by a kinase downstream of Akt and mTORC1, such as S6K1, rather than directly by Akt.	3
Histological examination (HE staining) showed that the tumor cells in three groups were all heterogeneous, the nuclei were enlarged, and the nucleus/cytoplasm ratio increased ( ).	1
Furthermore, real-time RT-PCR showed that expression of Gsk3β and CDK2 in SGC7901 was downregulated at mRNA level after exposure to fangchinoline ( ).	1
Using the NIH-3T3 transformation system, we have found that transformation by an exon 20 insertion mutant is resistant to inhibition by gefitinib and erlotinib.	1
Here, we provide evidence that RhoA is phosphorylated by ERK on 88S and 100T in response to EGF stimulation.	1
In transfection assays of HEK293T cells, we showed that Pak1 required Raf-1 to stimulate phosphorylation on serine 112.	1
In the EGFR family, ligand activation leads to receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the C-terminal region that provide docking sites for Src homology 2 or phosphotyrosine binding domain-containing signaling molecules ( ).	1
We found that the phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity was down-regulated in the heat shock protein20-overexpressing hepatocellular carcinoma cells compared with the control cells.	1
Taken together, the data with the recombinant SPR domain and the entire protein indicate that serine 986//S986 is the primary, but not the sole, ERK phosphorylation site in MED14.	1
It also follows from our findings that cancer patients who have been exposed to B-Raf- or MEK-targeted therapy or other similar therapies that may inhibit the MEK/ERK signaling are less likely to respond to treatment strategies that depend on TRAIL- or death receptor 5-mediated mechanisms.	2
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis confirmed that NDRG2 expression was significantly reduced in a series of adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma cell lines and primary acute-type adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma samples when compared with human T-cell leukaemia virus type 1-negative T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cell lines and CD4+ lymphocytes from healthy volunteers, respectively ( ).	1
Such effects were also shown in those Non-small cell lung cancer cell lines resistant to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, suggesting that metformin can revert resistance to gefitinib in some cancer cell lines.	2
Constitutive activation of phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Akt signaling due to a variety of genetic aberrations is frequently observed in a wide spectrum of human cancers. - Activated phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Akt signaling is the central effector of many downstream signaling pathways that regulate various cellular responses of tumors, including cell growth, transformation, differentiation, motility, survival, and chemosensitivity. , phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Akt signaling is involved in the inhibition of apoptosis via the phosphorylation of proapoptotic molecules, such as p53, Bad, and caspase-9, or modulating transcription factors (eg, c-Raf).	1
To provide further evidence that F395C mutant B56γ3 lacks p53-dependent tumor suppressive function, we tested whether expression of this mutant protein could inhibit cell proliferation in a p53-dependent manner.	3
Taken together, the data demonstrate that Src kinases upon activation by VEGFR-2 phosphorylate Y1173 of VEGFR-2 ( ).	1
Moreover, Tiam1 with a mutation in the Rac activation domain (GEF*), which renders it inactive, was unable to rescue the decrease in P*Pak seen on Tiam1 depletion ( , ), strongly suggesting that regulation of centrosomal Pak1/2 activity requires Tiam1-mediated Rac activation.	2
We had anticipated that the talazoparib + BKM-120 would have a greater than additive effect in vitro, suggesting that while we had good reason to choose BKM-120 it may not be the best agent to use in combination with talazoparib.	2
Indeed, mTOR/FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein mediates survival signals received through the receptors for IL-3, insulin, and insulin-like growth factor and may participate in oncogenic transformation . mTOR/FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein is constitutively active in mammalian cells, at least in the presence of serum and nutrients , suggesting that the cellular context rather than the expression level of mTOR/FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein dictates whether its proapoptotic or antiapoptotic function prevails.	2
Further study found that the last 66 amino acids of the N-terminus of adenovirus type 12 E1A were as effective as the wild-type E1A protein in preventing phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 at Ser276 and inhibiting major histocompatibility complex class I expression .	1
The result showed that Src homology 2 domain of c-Src interacts with IQGAP1 independent of its tyrosine phosphorylation since Src homology 2 domain of c-Src forms a complex with IQGAP1 prior to stimulation of cells with ligand ( ).	1
Inhibition of CXCR4 with AMD3100 significantly decreased invasion of MCF-7 CXCR4WT cells but not MCF-7 CXCR4ΔCTD cells, suggesting that signaling through constitutively active CXCR4 is ligand independent.	2
Last but not least, the gene array data together with our observations in suggest that CARP-1 functional mimetics impact the biological properties of migration and invasion by Medulloblastoma cells.	2
We have demonstrated that Tyr176 residue//Y176 in AKT kinase domain is necessary for Ack1/AKT interaction, thus, collectively it indicates that the Ack1 need both the PH domain and tyrosine176 in AKT kinase domain for complex formation.	1
These results demonstrated that RARα is physiologically implicated in the regulation of TAK165 and all-trans retinoic acid-mediated differentiation.	1
We showed here, with radioisotope, a more quantitative assay system, that there was still a substantial phosphorylation of BAD with the serine 112 and serine 136 double mutant.	1
We previously showed that such cells are fully transformed by the additional expression of oncogenic alleles of H- or K-RAS [ ].	1
However, we saw no difference in the ability of the S1466A or S1466 to aspartic acid mutant to co-precipitate Pak1 or Pak2 ( , ), suggesting that phosphorylation of Tiam1 at S1466 is not required for its interaction with Pak1/2.	2
In vivo experiments have indicated that only Ret9 is crucial for kidney development ( ; ).	1
Together, these results suggested that Ras increases both the DNA-binding activity and transcription function of SAF-1.	2
These findings suggest that the Ras and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways can be mutually regulated by several cross-talk mechanisms in different cellular contexts.	2
It is possible that HER2 molecules behave differently inside (this report) and outside ( ) the cell.	3
This global conformational change suggests how N-terminal SH2 domain disengagement from p110α could allosterically cause local conformational change in the kinase C-lobe that might impact on activity.	3
Interestingly, we observed that in contrast to wild type ASPP2, ASPP2 (S827A) remains at the plasma membrane following RAS activation by 4-OHT in the HKe3 ER:HRASV12 system ( ).	1
We found that P-REX1 levels are inversely correlated with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation and positively correlated with estrogen receptor α expression in human breast tumors.	1
Previous work has indicated that treatment of cells with phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase inhibitors reduces levels of EGF-induced complex formation between Gab1 and the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 [ ].	1
Accordingly, phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Akt and mTOR are candidate signaling pathways that may mediate the effect of TDRG1 in testicular germ cell tumors.	2
The Thr732//T732 phosphorylation was U0126-sensitive and was observed in a kinase-dead mutant of ERK5 as well, suggesting that ERK1/2 can phosphorylate ERK5 at Thr732.	2
We recently showed that Src kinase binds to and preferentially tyrosyl-phosphorylates GTP-loaded Ras on tyrosine at position 32 within the switch I region; an event that is associated with Raf displacement while increasing GAP binding and GTP hydrolysis .	1
Studies with HS1-/- mice ( ) and with a mutant WEHI-231 cell line that expresses very low level of HS1 ( ) suggest that HS1 plays roles in not only B cell proliferation but also apoptosis upon B cell antigen receptor cross-linking.	2
Animal studies revealed that this combination has greater effect than either drug alone in reducing tumor volume, providing a strong rationale for the advancement of this combination into clinical studies in Small cell lung cancer patients.	2

In line with this, it has been suggested that ubiquitylation might be involved in Rac1 dynamics in peripheral membrane ruffles and sorting of Rac1 in endocytic vesicles. , Further work will likely decipher the importance of Rac1 ubiquitylation not only as a restrictive regulation of its signaling, but also as a mean to modulate its interactions with effectors and with the membrane.	3
We cannot exclude that this mechanism works also in this system and that RhoA activity participates to the motile phenotype observed in the cells expressing the different p27 mutants.	1
We posited that the more variable regions found toward the C- and N-terminus ( ) of B56γ were most likely the areas of potential interaction with p53 due to their variation from the sequence of the non-interacting B56α protein and their position in the potential substrate binding area of the B56γ-PP2A holoenzyme complex as described in crystallographic studies ( ; ).	1

The role of c-Abl and its target effectors in EC are unknown; however, given the central role of nmMLCK in EC barrier regulation, we speculated that the interaction between c-Abl and nmMLCK may be a key signaling event affecting lamellipodial formation, cytoskeletal remodeling, and focal adhesion dynamics, events which regulate EC barrier permeability.	2

It has been shown that RICTOR-mTOR (TORC2) can directly interact with AKT and phosphorylate Ser473, and it is widely accepted that TORC2 is the principal AKT Ser473 kinase upon growth factor stimulation.	2
Since AMPK activators such as AICAR or metformin can overcome the inhibitory effects of Ser487 phosphorylation on replication of the hepatitis C virus [ ], our present results raise the exciting prospect that AMPK activators such as metformin, which are already used to treat Type 2 diabetes, might also be efficacious in treatment of tumours in which the Akt pathway is hyperactivated.	3

Western blot analysis showed that exposure of SGC7901 to 10/20/30 μmol/l fangchinoline for 48 h dramatically decreased protein expression of Gsk3β and CDK2 ( ), indicating fangchinoline arrests cells at G1 phase and then suppresses cell growth via downregulated Gsk3β and CDK2.	1
Structural analysis predicts that mutation of R509//R509 will diminish contacts between the two interacting proteins and reduce dimer formation, as also recently reported .	2
However, disrupting the interaction of 14-3-3ζ and p85 by targeting the 14-3-3/p85 interface may be a drugable target since our data demonstrated that mutation of serine 83 on p85 reduced transformation-related properties of cancer cells.	1
We previously demonstrated that Src activation regulates a subset of phenotypic alterations induced by the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor tyrosine kinase (CSF-1R), which has been implicated in the progression of multiple types of carcinoma including breast cancer , , , , , , .	1

Previous studies have utilized activated mutant variants of non-receptor tyrosine kinases like SRC to identify downstream substrates of this kinase subfamily; however, these overexpressed, constitutively active mutants likely display promiscuous activities that do not necessarily reflect the substrates of the endogenous protein when activated by an upstream Receptor tyrosine kinase.	2
Together, our data suggest that the increased level of FAM83B observed in many cancers results in increased localization of p110α to the membrane, and activation of downstream AKT/mTOR signaling (Fig and ) and suggests that the therapeutic targeting of FAM83B may suppress PI3K/AKT activation and ultimately inhibit tumor growth.

However, the concentration of CaMKKα used in these experiments was approx. 20-fold higher than that required to obtain a comparable level of phosphorylation of AMPK-α1 (results not shown).	1
Since we observed that both CD24 mRNA and protein is significantly and substantially downregulated by the Raf and phosphoinositide-3-kinase pathways we next determined if inhibition of either or both of these pathways could restore CD24 expression in RasV12 cells at the mRNA level.	3
Using transfection assays in HEK293T cells, we also confirmed that Pak1 can phosphorylate serine 112 through Raf-1.	2
We demonstrated that Pyk2 was rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated following T cell antigen receptor stimulation.	1
Our initial observation demonstrated that mutation of tyrosines 799//Y799, 820, 925 to phenylalanine (F) and deletion of C-terminus of VEGFR-2 coupled with mutation of tyrosines 1173 and 1212 has no effect on the ability of VEGFR-2 to associate with the Src homology 2 domain of c-Src ( ).	1
This suggests to us that the AMPK subunits recovered by Anderson et al. [ ] in their anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates may have been an artefact caused by the high level of FLAG-CaMKKβ expression in the cells.	2
We now report in the November issue of Developmental Cell that the E3 ubiquitin-ligase HACE1 catalyzes the ubiquitylation of GTP-bound Rac1.	1
PI-103 can not only inhibit phosphoinositide 3-kinase, but it also inhibits mTOR and DNA-dependent protein kinase, a feature that has been used in a variety of in vivo efficacy models, and can even have a certain effect on glioblastomas ( ).	2
Western bolt assay demonstrated that BMP9 inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT in SK-BR-3 cells ( ).	1
While our data support the inference that Pak activation at centrosomes is downstream of Rac ( ), we showed that phosphorylation of Aurora A is independent of Tiam1-Rac-Pak signalling, at least during prophase (neither knockdown of Tiam1, nor of individual Pak isoforms-which perturb centrosome separation-appeared to change the phosphorylation of Aurora A; ).	1
Our study highlights the predictive potential of mathematical modelling approaches, and demonstrates that a simple intervention (MEK-inhibition) could be of therapeutic benefit in preventing invasive migration and metastasis.	1
This suggests that in vivo, Abl preferentially phosphorylates site 4 (Y361) relative to site 1 (Y295), since little binding was seen with the RasGAP C-terminal SH2 probe which is highly specific to site 1.	2
We demonstrate here that Shank3 also has a defined biological role outside of neuronal tissues, and that Shank3 actively participates in signal transduction.	1
Previously, we observed that cells stably expressing FGFR2 exhibit elevated receptor phosphorylation in the basal state ( ; ).	1
We found that mutating serine 111 to alanine in full length BAD reduced Pak1 stimulated phosphorylation at serine 112 ( lane 4).	1
A survey of 98 signaling antibodies found that phosphorylation at serine 112//S112 and serine 136//S136 were pharmacodynamic markers for measuring the effectiveness of Pak inhibitors in vivo - .	1
To determine the role that PI3K/mTOR pathway mutations may play in sensitivity to BKM-120, we identified cell lines with such mutations.	2
It has been shown that the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis is an important mediator in activation of matrix metalloproteinases , which can facilitate metastasis by proteolyzing the extracellular matrix, thus promoting the migration of tumor cells through the basement membrane and into the lymphovascular system.	2
That both bands likely correspond to differentially phosphorylated forms of T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule was concluded from the two-dimensional antiphosphotyrosine Western blot analysis of anti-T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule immunoprecipitates prepared from short-term (2 min) activated HPB-ALL cells shown in Fig. , top, B.	1
We recently showed that Rac is able to downregulate Rho activity and that the reciprocal balance between Rac and Rho activity is a major determinant of cellular morphology and motility in NIH3T3 fibroblasts.	1
Note that we do not have an antibody that distinguishes between MARK2 and MARK3 so the activity measured with this antibody could represent either MARK2 or MARK3, or a combination of the two.	3
This also resulted in a high level of apoptosis ( E), presumably because this fragment, which is unable to displace endogenous FAK from focal contacts, could act as a sink for important components of the survival complex that would ordinarily bind to Proline-rich region 1 in endogenous FAK.	3
Results show that threonine 198A protein displays a 3 fold higher affinity for CDK2 respect to the WT one (p<0.01), while the affinity for CDK4 was similar for all mutants (p>0.05) ( ), thus confirming the results obtained from others .	1
In contrast, transfection of the dominant-negative form of Akt decreased the expression of muscle-specific proteins and myotube formation, suggesting that Akt may be an essential downstream component of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-regulated skeletal muscle differentiation.	2
We previously demonstrated that Ack1 regulates phosphorylation of androgen receptor and tumor suppressor Wwox in human prostate tumors.	1
S1 (A-C) shows fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy data to demonstrate that Grb2 binds to FGFR2, but not FGFR1 or the oncogenic mutant S252W mutant FGFR2.	1
These data indicate that a specific, dose-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Rac1 at Y64 by both FAK and Src may occur in vitro.	2
In addition, pharmacological inhibitor of MEK could reverse the effects of Gab2 on colorectal cancer cells migration and invasion, and partially restore E-cadherin expression, suggesting that Gab2-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition is dependent on MEK/ERK signaling in colorectal cancer.	3
Based on the amino acid sequence analysis we found that Orf virus-encoded protein 002 shares three putative conserved protein domains with the E1A-12 protein.	1
It is also possible that under-sampling contributes to the disparities between the studies due to the nature of mass spectrometry-based studies.	2
This is in agreement with our presented data here as well as previous reports that showed growth arrest occurred in the absence of apoptosis following glioma cell treatment with PI-103 or oesteosarcoma cell treatment with ETP-45658 [ , ].	1
More recent studies showed that they can have differential functional outcomes, in terms of chemotactic and metastatic phenotypes ( ) and transforming potential ( ) of isogenic human breast cancer cells.	2
To test the biological importance of the observed RAS-apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 interactions, we first examined the cellular localisation of exogenously coexpressed HRASV12 and ASPP2, and observed that they colocalise to the cell membrane in U2OS cells ( ).	1
PCR analysis of the resulting cDNA using primers that can distinguish follicular dendritic cell and B cell isoforms of CD21 indicated that both isoforms were present in approximately equal proportions (data not shown).	2
Given that Sirt1-independent mechanisms were recently reported in the action of resveratrol, this current study therefore focuses on resveratrol as a potential signal transduction inhibitor of carcinogen-mediated induction of the NF-κB pathway in a human brain EC model and questions the involvement of Sirt1.	1
These findings suggest that the Grb2 binding site on EGFR is redundant for signaling, but critical for receptor regulation.	2
To show that uPAR signals through DOCK180 to activate Rac, we used ectopic expression in human embryonic kidney 293T cells that lack endogenous uPAR.	1
Thus AMPK has a cytostatic effect on proliferating cells, suggesting that it might exert some of the tumour suppressor effects of its upstream kinase, LKB1.	3
Finally, the results shown in and show that the two known mechanisms by which phosphorylation of AMPK is activated, i.e. inhibition of dephosphorylation by AMP and increased phosphorylation via activation of CaMKKβ by Ca2+ can, under the right circumstances, be synergistic.	1
In good agreement with the formation of a Chibby-14-3-3-β-catenin complex, we also found that increased expression of 14-3-3 or β-catenin does not interfere with Chibby-β-catenin or Chibby-14-3-3 complex formation (Fig. S2, available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200709091/DC1).	1
Importantly, we provide a novel mechanism that fangchinoline targets phosphoinositide 3-kinase, which promotes tumor cell survival and invasion by suppressing the phosphorylation of Akt (Ser308).	1
This suggests that the amount of active LKB1 was limited by the availability of STRADα and mouse protein 25-α.	2
Hong et al. [ ] reported that FLAG-tagged LKB1 expressed in, and purified from, COS7 cells would activate a recombinant AMP-activated protein kinase heterotrimer, and phosphorylate the α subunit at Thr172, in cell-free assays.	2
Both of the mutations that passed validation in the The Cancer Genome Atlas data set could be considered activating mutations based on their location within the N-SH2/protein tyrosine phosphatase domain interface.	3
In our recent study [ ], we found that deletion of Klf5 in Pten-null mouse prostates resulted in larger tumors without lumens and necrosis, which were present in tumors induced by Pten deletion alone [ ] but with enhanced activation of AKT and ERK, which are reported to promote tumor angiogenesis [ , ].	1
However, given the apparent number and diversity of both PTEN's normal functions and of the effects of PTEN loss on tumour development in different tissues ( ; ), it seems quite possible that other mechanisms of action may account for some of PTEN's functions and tumour suppressor activities in some tissues.	2
We speculate that AKT too might possess a masked anion binding pocket, and Tyr-phosphorylation induced conformational changes could unmask this pocket allowing it to bind phosphatidic acid.	3
However, our data demonstrate that this effect is not due to the absence of phosphorylation but rather to the steric hindrance of the last amino-acid, indicating that changes in the conformation of the C-terminal tail of p27 render the protein more prone to its proteasomal degradation.	1
Because NDRG2 has been shown to have growth inhibitory effects on several malignant cell lines through downregulation of several signalling pathways, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT, janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription and nuclear factor-kappaB signalling , one may speculate that the phosphorylation of different proteins involved in these signalling pathways is regulated by the PP2A-NDRG2 complex.	2
Knockdown of Grb2 elevates Shp2 phosphorylation ( ), strongly suggesting that the inability of Shp2 to interact directly with the receptor in the presence of Grb2 prevents FGFR2 kinase activity toward Shp2.	2
ANOVA results indicated that both pTyr284-Ack1 and pTyr176-AKT expression differed significantly among progression stages (p<0.0001).	1
Mutation of Y1052//Y1052 only slightly reduced phosphorylation of Y1173//Y1173, suggesting that Y1057//Y1057 but not Y1052//Y1052, is specifically involved in modulation of phosphorylation of Y1173//Y1173 ( ).	2
Despite recent reports, we could not find any evidence that the α and/or β subunits of AMPK formed a stable complex with CaMKKβ.	3
Of note, we found that the ectopic expression of NDRG2 in two human cancer cell lines carrying wild-type PTEN ((SAS (oral squamous cell carcinoma) and HeLa (cervical cancer)) resulted in marked decreases in PTEN-Ser380/Thr382/Thr383 phosphorylation and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT inactivation ( ). These findings suggest that downregulation of NDRG2 could have an important role in activating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT signalling pathway in various types of cancer. In this study, we show that NDRG2 interacts with PTEN and promotes its dephosphorylation at Ser380/Thr382/Thr383 by recruiting PP2A to PTEN. We also demonstrated that loss of NDRG2 expression via genetic or epigenetic abnormalities in adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma cells can contribute to the increase in PTEN-Ser380/Thr382/Thr383 phosphorylation, which leads to inactivation of PTEN lipid phosphatase activity and activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT pathway. The imbalance of the expression of NDRG2 and as yet unidentified protein kinases might account for an elevation of PTEN-Ser380/Thr382/Thr383 phosphorylation with a high amount of phosphorylated AKT in adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma cells. Finally, we showed that NDRG2-deficient mice develop multiple types of tumours, thus establishing that loss of NDRG2 expression can contribute to tumour development. PTEN stability and lipid phosphatase activity can be regulated through phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail, which contains a cluster of serine-threonine residues: Ser370, Ser380, Thr382, Thr383 and Ser385 (ref. ). Although the cluster of Ser380/Thr382/Thr383 residues in the C-terminal tail are thought to be minor phosphorylation sites , the level of phosphorylated PTEN-Ser380/Thr382/Thr383 has been shown to be rapidly and transiently increased in hypothalamic cells treated with leptin and in rat brains following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion . CK2 is known to be a major kinase that phosphorylates PTEN at the C-terminal serine-threonine cluster, but phosphorylation of Ser380/Thr382/Thr383 by CK2 is still under debate . We observed that suppression of CK2 activity with specific inhibitors in adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma cells did not influence PTEN-Ser380/Thr382/Thr383 phosphorylation.	1
We report here that apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 1 and 2, two activators of p53, preferentially bind active RAS via their N-terminal RAS-association domains .	2
Endogenous p85 and Abi1 could be coimmunoprecipitated ( A, left, and supplemental materials), and a wortmannin-sensitive (Fig S1, available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200206079/DC1) phosphoinositide 3-kinase enzymatic activity was detected in Abi1 immunocomplexes ( A, right), suggesting that the p110-p85 complex binds to Abi1. p85 interacts with Abi1. (A) Left; lysates (5 mg) from MEFs were immunoprecipitated (IP) and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies (ctr, preimmune serum).	3
Altogether, these data suggest that mTOR/FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein is activated in syncytia, where it directly phosphorylates p53 within the nucleus.	2
Silencing β1 integrin but not β3 integrin blocked uPAR-dependent ERK activation, showing that ERK activation by uPAR requires β1 but not β3 integrin ( ).	1
Besides mutation, overexpression of Ras that facilitates Ras-mediated signaling has been reported in human cancer - .	1
A, left, demonstrates that depletion of CD3 molecules results in a 67% reduction of detectable T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule in cell lysates.	1
Thus, these findings, together with our observation that Src stimulates SYNJ2 5'-phosphatase activity, strongly suggest that SYNJ2 stimulates invadopodia/podosome formation by producing PtdIns(3,4)P2 through hydrolysis of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and subsequent recruitment of Tks5.	2
Our recent study demonstrated that Klf5 deletion promotes mouse prostate tumorigenesis initiated by Pten deletion, as indicated by the accelerated emergence and progression of mPIN caused by Pten insufficiency and the more severe morphological and molecular abnormalities of prostate tumors caused by Pten deficiency [ ].	1
From the comparative analysis, we determined that 35 of the CSF-1R induced phosphoproteins did not overlap with those identified in any of the analyzed Receptor tyrosine kinase studies ( ).	1
Thirdly, if the effect of AMP on phosphorylation of Thr172//T172 on AMPK is due to inhibition of dephosphorylation we were puzzled as to why, in cells such as HeLa cells that express CaMKKβ but lack LKB1, AMPK is not activated by treatments that increase intracellular AMP [ ].	3
These data suggest that SMYD3 may act in concert with MEK1/2 signaling in tumorigenesis.	2
These results suggest that pharmacologic manipulation of SHP2 activity could influence the oncogenic potential of cancer-causing Ras mutants.	3
As the group I p21-activated kinases, known Rac effector kinases, have previously been shown to be present on centrosomes in early mitosis, we hypothesized that in addition to their other mitotic roles p21-activated kinases may also play a role downstream of Tiam1 and Rac in regulating centrosome separation.	3
We go on to show that G-protein-coupled receptors couple to phosphoinositide 3-kinase via Dock180/Elmo1-mediated RAC activation and subsequent interaction with p110β.	1
Considering that there is a background level of phosphatase activity of PP2A-B56γ1 at 0 min in Calu1 carcinoma cells, one possibility is that the extinction of PP2A-B56γ1 activity in the early phase might be important to achieve stable signalling for induction of ERK phosphorylation.	3
Site-directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrate that tyrosines 600//Y600 and 778 of EphB1 are required for its interaction with c-Src and p52Shc.	1
Although VEGF, another key angiogenesis regulator and secretory protein induced by hypoxia inducible factor 1α [ ], was not identified by the microarray analysis as being upregulated by Klf5 deletion, our expression analyses demonstrated that KLF5 loss indeed upregulated hypoxia inducible factor 1α at the protein level and VEGF and PDGF at both the mRNA and protein levels in both mouse prostate tumors and human prostate cancer cells with deficient or insufficient PTEN (Figure , and ).	1
In addition, our data show that over-expression of c-Src in PAE cells highly enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of IQGAP1.	1
The data in suggest that the Ras-ERK pathway is not primarily responsible for transduction of matrix survival signals from fibronectin in anchorage-dependent rabbit synovial fibroblasts.	2
By stable transfection into E-cadherin-deficient cell lines, we show that cadherins are both necessary and sufficient for recruitment of p120 to junctions.	1
More importantly, we show that F395C is unable to promote p53 Thr55 dephosphorylation, transcriptional activation of p21, and the p53-dependent tumor suppressive function of PP2A.	1
Given the evidence that p120 is a key regulator of cadherin stability and localization, these phosphorylation events may be critical to the regulation of p120 function and activity. p120 has multiple tyrosine residues that can be modified by SRC; yet the functional consequences of phosphorylation on p120 function are not well understood , .	2
These data indicated that epithelial to mesenchymal transition in MCF10A.ζ cells is independent of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt pathway but is primarily dependent on the TGFβ-smad-SIP1 signaling pathway as we previously reported ( ).	1
Studies show that TAK165 exhibits an antitumor effect on a variety of human cancer cells, including acute myeloid leukemias, by inducing apoptosis .	1
Potential structural differences in the architecture of the TCR-CD3-ζ-T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule complex could also be important in light of the fact that T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule is expressed at all stages of T cell development (ranging from fetal thymocytes of week 14-17 of embryonic development, to adult thymocytes and mature T cells).	3
We have shown that mutant HRAS is a potential drug target in different types of cancer including lung cancer and bladder cancer.	1
As Ras transduces signals from many different receptor tyrosine kinases that are known to be overexpressed in glioblastoma multiforme, including EGFR, FGFR and platelet-derived growth factor receptor, targeting SHP2 may prove more effective in glioblastoma multiforme, which respond poorly to kinase inhibitor monotherapy.	2
Our previous studies demonstrate that BMP9 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of triple-negative MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells and promoted their apoptosis in vitro and in vivo .	1
We thus speculated that threonine 198//T198 phosphorylation may favor this interaction in cells adhered to FN.	2
Furthermore, LY294002 or U0126 attenuated the level of activated VEGF mRNA transcripts, but did not change the activated hypoxia-inducible factor-1α mRNA transcription level under hypoxia ( ), demonstrating that ERK and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase did not regulate hypoxia-inducible factor-1α expression during hypoxia at the transcriptional level. (A) Effect of hypoxia on the activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and ERK.	1
Our study shows that recruitment and activation of c-Src by VEGFR-2 plays a pivotal role in relaying angiogenic signaling of VEGFR-2; it phosphorylates VEGFR-2 at Y1173, facilitates association and activation of IQGAP1 and other signaling proteins to VEGFR-2.	1
We first looked at the transcription of the different constructs that, as expected, was similar in all mutants as indicated by semiquantitative RT-PCR ( ).	1
In addition, annexin V/PI staining showed that TAS-116 significantly enhanced apoptosis induced by dabrafenib in the U266 myeloma cell line (P < 0.001 in the combination treatment versus TAS-116 monotherapy; P < 0.01 in the combination treatment versus dabrafenib monotherapy) ( ).	1
We do not rule out the possibility that other tyrosine kinases may be able to target AKT for Tyr176-phosphorylation.	2
While prior reports have shown that inhibition of B-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling with B-Raf inhibitors (e.g., Raf265, L-779450 and sorafenib) sensitizes certain types of cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, - these results were generated under conditions in which the cancer cells were co-treated with the combination of a given inhibitor and TRAIL.	1
"We demonstrated that EphB1 could discriminate ephrinB1 surface density to direct integrin-mediated cell adhesion through ""inside-out"" signaling ( )."	1
It has been widely suggested that p120 is a relatively minor constituent of cadherin complexes ( ; ; ; ), with the highest published estimate of the amount of p120 binding to cadherins being 24% ( ).	2
We now report that fibronectin survival signals conveyed by the FAK-Cas complex require Ras.	1
Since P-REX1 requires PIP3 for activation [ ], P-REX1 promotes phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT and MEK/ERK signaling ( ), and combined inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and MEK has strong anti-tumor effects (reviewed in ref. [ ]), we hypothesized that P-REX1-expressing cells would be sensitized to pharmacologic inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.	3
Also, together with previously published experiments ( ), although not in U87MG cells, we show that the epithelial to mesenchymal transition of cells in the chick embryo primitive streak is inhibited solely via the protein phosphatase activity of PTEN.	1
The fact that CARP-1 functional mimetic-4 treatment of Daoy cells resulted in a 2-fold down-regulation of MMP10 ( ), and that the activities of matrix metallopeptidases were found to be associated with glioblastoma and Medulloblastoma cell invasiveness - , we determined whether and to what extent exposure to CARP-1 functional mimetics resulted in reduced activities of various matrix metallopeptidases.	1
All fusion proteins/complexes were purified on glutathione-Sepharose and the upstream kinases were tested for their ability to phosphorylate and activate GST-α1-KD, GST-BRSK1 and GST-BRSK2 in cell-free assays. (A) shows that, although the LKB1 complex and CaMKKβ were both able to activate GST-α1-KD, only the LKB1 complex was able to activate GST-BRSK1 and GST-BRSK2.	1
"The algorithm of ""activated transcription factor regulating genes in the experimental data"" was used to build a hypoxia inducible factor 1α-centered network with those that were not only direct transcriptionally activated targets of hypoxia inducible factor 1α but were also upregulated by Klf5 deletion."	1
Western blot analysis demonstrated that the degradation rate of p27threonine 198A/G mutants tested in the presence of proteasomal extract derived from HT-1080 cells transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin was higher respect to that of the WT protein or substituted with the V or E amino-acids ( ).	1
It is likely that this possible feedback loop leads to an amplified pro-apoptotic signal.	3
Hence these results reinforce our previously reported finding that Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling positively regulates death receptor 5 expression. , As demonstrated previously, , Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling activates CHOP and Elk1-dependent death receptor 5 transcription, resulting in elevated death receptor 5 expression.	1
It is now recognized that in addition to the C-terminal prenylation of Rho proteins for anchoring at the membrane, the activity of Rho GTPases in cells is also modulated by several posttranslational modifications such as ubiquitylation, sumoylation, serotonylation and phosphorylation.	1
In order to provide evidence that p53 Thr55 phosphorylation status was contributing to the p53-dependent tumor suppressive function of B56γ, similar cell proliferation experiments were performed in H1299 cells that lack functional wild type p53.	1
These findings demonstrate that EGFR autophosphorylation is enhanced on the Gab1 (which recruits PI3K and SHP2) and PLCγ binding sites, and suppressed on the c-Cbl and the Grb2 binding sites in the presence of HER2.	1
Our results show that HRAS mutations in cancer activate the RAS and mTOR pathways which might serve as a therapeutic option for patients with HRAS mutant tumors.	3
It is also possible however that SYNJ2 contributes to invadopodia formation by hydrolyzing PtdIns(4,5)P2.	2
Second, our kinetic data revealed that Rac activation persists long after the return to basal levels of Ras-GTP, a finding not immediately reconcilable with a simple and unique Ras→Rac pathway.	1
The result showed that silencing the expression of c-Src in endothelial cells significantly inhibits the ability of VEGFR-2 to stimulate proliferation of these primary endothelial cells ( ).	1
Although it is reported that ERK and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase could have crosstalk in some conditions , it is likely that hypoxia may act on two parallel and distinct signalling pathways to induce Rac1 activity, because ERK phosphorylation was not inhibited by phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor, and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase activity was not inhibited by ERK inhibitor either.	2
Therefore, we anticipated that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signalling might affect Smad2/3 degradation through altering the phosphorylation of this residue.	3
It may also be relevant to these ideas that our expression experiments lead us to believe that the PTEN Y138L protein could be generally slightly less stable than wild-type PTEN, as we consistently required more plasmid or viral expression vector (usually 2-3 fold) to achieve the same level of protein expression and PTEN Y138L was slightly less stable to thermal denaturation than the wild-type enzyme ( ).	2
This raises the question of how survival signals from fibronectin might be passed to the Ras pathway in cells that express FRNK rather than FAK in focal contacts and therefore form a FRNK-Cas complex.	3
We show that via phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase, Pak2 activation results in Erk activation in untransformed cells with endogenous levels of signal transduction proteins.	1
We have previously observed that increased expression of CARP-1 stimulated apoptosis that involved activation of p38, while blockage of p38 activation abrogated CARP-1-mediated apoptosis .	1
These results together demonstrate that pre-exposure of Ras-mutant cancer cells to PLX4032 enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis in these cells.	1
Our evidence suggests that fangchinoline is a potential anticancer drug as the natural inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase.	2
It is well known that the aberrant expression of Cyclin D1 and CDK4 proteins is involved in the proliferation of CRC cells ( ).	1
As well as identifying a novel Cdk1 site required for the function of Tiam1 in mitosis, we also show that group I p21-activated kinases are activated downstream of Tiam1 on centrosomes in prophase in a manner dependent on the above phosphorylation event, and that both Pak1 and Pak2 function to antagonize centrosome separation.	1
Consistent with this expectation, our current studies demonstrate that CARP-1 functional mimetic-4 suppressed Medulloblastoma cells growth by activating caspases and inducing apoptosis signaling as well as by diminishing the levels of cell cycle regulatory protein cyclin B1.	1
Here, we have shown that RhoA phosphorylation enhances its interaction with ROCK1, but does not affect its interaction with mDia ( ).	1
Immunoprecipitation using p85-P-serine 83//S83 antibody followed by western blotting with p85-P-serine 83//S83 antibody demonstrated that the p85-P-serine 83//S83 antibody recognized serine 83//S83 phosphorylated p85 in vivo ( , left).	1
Interestingly, we found that high expression levels of 14-3-3ζ were associated with increased Akt phosphorylation/activation in human mammary epithelial cells ( ).	1
Both molecules are type III transmembrane molecules that have only a very short extracellular domain and possess a number of potential tyrosine-phosphorylation sites in their intracytoplasmic tails that could mediate binding to src homology 2 domains of intracellular signaling molecules.	3
For example, it has been reported that ubiquitin and Tollip bind to an overlapping region of the GAT-domain of Tom1 in a mutually exclusive manner.	1
Here, we revealed the molecular mechanism by which SHP2 regulates Ras activity and show that elevated SHP2 activity drives glioblastoma multiforme progression via Ras activation.	1
In the HeLa cell, derived from a cervical cancer that had undergone a large deletion in STK11 [ ], increases in AMP and ADP do not enhance Thr172 phosphorylation [ ] because the basal activity of CaMKKβ is too low to support this unless intracellular Ca2+ is also elevated [ ].	1
Data showed that no significant differences could be observed in the ability to enter into the cell cycle among the different mutants analyzed.	3
In addition, annexin V/PI staining showed that TAS-116 significantly enhanced apoptosis induced by these inhibitors in rat sarcoma-mutated myeloma cell lines (P < 0.01 in each combination treatment versus either monotherapy or control in NCI-H929 and myeloma.1S cell lines; P < 0.05 in each combination treatment versus either monotherapy or control in RPMI-8226 cell line; P < 0.01 in dabrafenib and AZD6244 combination treatment versus either monotherapy or control, and P < 0.01 in tipifarnib combination treatment versus monotherapy or control in INA6 cell line) ( ). (A) NCI-H929 cells, (B) INA6, (C) RPMI8226, and (D) myeloma1.S cells were treated with TAS-116 (0-1 μM) in combination with tipifarnib (0-2 μM), dabrafenib (0-5 μM), or AZD6244 (0-4 μM) for 48 h, and then the viability was analyzed with the MTT assay.	1
S1 (D-F) demonstrates that FRS2 does not interact with FGFR2 in the nonstimulated state.	1
Using this tool it is possible to follow the transduced cells that express the exogenous protein avoiding the influence of the GFP protein on the studied transgene.	2
It has been reported previously that prior phosphorylation of Ser485//S485 on rat AMPK-α1 by Akt, within a rat α1β1γ1 complex, caused a 40% reduction in the rate of subsequent phosphorylation of Thr172 and activation by LKB1 in cell-free assays, an effect that was abolished by a non-phosphorylatable S485A substitution [ ].	1
On the contrary, it has been reported that negative feedback regulation of FGF signaling (FGF2/4/8) is not mediated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, but by an Erk1/2-dependent Ets transcription factor, in MKP3 expression .	1
Interestingly, we found fangchinoline could suppress the phosphoinositide 3-kinase in SGC7901 cells, which implies that fangchinoline targets phosphoinositide 3-kinase in tumor cells that highly express phosphoinositide 3-kinase and inhibits their proliferation, migration, and invasion.	3
It appears that even a single copy of this mutation may affect the function of the wild type protein, because when levels of F395C expression are comparable to endogenous levels, there is a decrease in p53 Thr55 dephosphorylation after DNA damage ( ).	2
It is noteworthy to mention that Y63//Y63 is not only a component of a signaling motif that potentially binds to src homology 2 domains of src-kinases; it could also mediate binding to the src homology 2 domain of Grb2 (because of the presence of an asparagine in the +2 position).	3
Reprobing for EGFR showed that comparable amount of both WT-EGFR and Y1068F-EGFR were present in all lanes.	1
Previously, we found that Tiam1-expressing RasV12-transformed MDCK cells showed a fibroblast-like migratory phenotype when seeded on collagen, but an epithelial phenotype when seeded on fibronectin or laminin ( ).	1
Moreover, evidence that the nuclear factor-kappaB pathway may be inhibited through the targeting of IκK phosphorylation capacity that ultimately may reduce both the acquisition of a pro-inflammatory phenotype, as reflected by decreased COX-2 expression, and the acquisition of pro-angiogenic phenotype, as reflected by a decrease in MMP-9.	2
As shown in , CbyS18A or CbyS22P, which harbors a motif that matches perfectly the mode II consensus sequence, interacted with 14-3-3ζ as efficiently as CbyWT.	1
This could indicate that several of the eight individual tyrosine residues in the intracellular portion of T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule represent targets for T Cell Receptor-activated PTKs.	3
This is consistent with the role of β1 integrin in promoting cell surface expression of β3 integrin by cooperating with uPAR to activate ERK, a function of β1 integrin that is not required in the tumor cells where ERK activity does not require β1 integrin ( ). β3 integrin is required for p130Cas substrate domain tyrosine phosphorylation and formation of the p130Cas-CrkII complex. (A) p130Cas substrate domain tyrosine phosphorylation in siRNA-transfected cells.	1
These results indicate that Bam32 can interact with tyrosine-phosphorylated signaling molecules after B cell activation through its src homology 2 domain and may function in part by regulating the activity and/or location of phospholipase Cγ2.	2
Some of the loss of Vav effects are also observed in Gab2-deficient cells, which differ most notably from linker for activation of T cells-deficient cells in that Gab2 is required for a PI3 kinase response whereas loss of linker for activation of T cells has no effect on the PI3 kinase pathway ( ).	3
Gab1 contains a number of tyrosine residues that could serve as potential binding sites for the SH2 domain containing proteins Grb2, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, and the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 [ ].	3
Here we report that PRL-3 is phosphorylated both in vitro and in vivo downstream of Src, and that this phosphorylation is required for PRL-3 to promote invasion, motility and activation of RhoC in cell culture systems.	1
Our results, therefore, suggest that inhibition of β-catenin signaling by Chibby involves at least two distinct molecular mechanisms ( ); i.e., competing with Tcf/Lef transcription factors for binding to β-catenin in the nucleus ( ) and facilitating nuclear export of β-catenin via interaction with 14-3-3 upon its phosphorylation by Akt.	2
Thus the serine-proline-rich domain in MED14 may serve as an integration point for multiple pathways that influence Mediator function.	2
We found that glutamate-induced translocation was inhibited by AP-5, an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist.	1
A Rac1/Pak1/MEK1/2 complex has been described [ ]; we speculate that this complex may also bind ERK1/2.	2
Despite the close similarity in the sequences surrounding Thr172//T172 on AMPK and the equivalent threonine residue on the ARKs ( ), it is clear that the latter are not phosphorylated significantly by CaMKKs either in intact cells ( and ) or in cell-free assays ( ).	1
Figure shows that AMP-activated protein kinase kinase activity that activated the AMP-activated protein kinaseα1 catalytic domain above the basal activity, and phosphorylated Thr172, could be immunoprecipitated from untransfected HEK-293T cell extract using anti-LKB1 antibody (lane 1), but not pre-immune control immunoglobulin (lane 2).	3
Given that the involvement of Sirt1still remains undefined, at least within the carcinogenic context we report herein, our second objective was evaluated and confirmed a Sirt1-independent, but efficient, targeting by resveratrol of the PMA-induced nuclear factor-kappaB signaling pathway that ultimately leads to reduced MMP-9 and COX-2 expression.	1
These results suggest that the components required for activation of Net1 following ionizing radiation are all present in the nucleus.	2
To confirm that Ser487//S487 was phosphorylated directly by Akt in the cells, and not by a downstream kinase such as p70 S6K1, we tested the effects of rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTORC1.	1
These studies have suggested that multiple signaling pathways are involved in MKP3 expression.	2
Accordingly, it has been demonstrated that, under particular stress conditions, p27 is recognized by the heat-shock protein Hsp27 and this interaction eventually results in accelerated protein degradation .	1
Recent work shows that binding of ATP-competitive inhibitors to AKT and PKC inhibits their activity, but induces the active, phosphorylated state of these kinases - .	1
Together, these data indicate that even though activation of either the phosphoinositide-3-kinase or Raf pathway is sufficient to decrease CD24 mRNA and protein expression, inhibition of both phosphoinositide-3-kinase and Raf together is not sufficient to restore CD24 surface protein or mRNA expression.	1
Moreover, this suggests that a simple Rac to RhoA switch does not accurately describe the dynamics of RhoGTPase activity in invading cancer cells.	2
It has been shown that B56α-PP2A (PPP2R5A) dephosphorylates the c-myc oncogene at Ser62 leading to its inactivation ( ), B56δ-PP2A (PPP2R5D) dephosphorylates Cdc25 blocking cell cycle progression ( ; ), and B56γ-PP2A (PPP2R5C) was shown to be important in SV40 mediated cell transformation ( ).	1
Another group among the 36 genes that play a role in angiogenesis and were upregulated by Klf5 deletion in mouse prostates (Figure A, Additional file : Table S1) included Il1 and Ang, both encoding secretory proteins in prostatic epithelial cells that could also mediate the role of KLF5 loss in angiogenesis.	3
The general similarity of response in these cells suggests that Vav and linker for activation of T cells are in the same pathway for many responses but are independent for others.	2
We herein demonstrate that HSP20 interacts with phosphoinositide 3-kinase and downregulates its activity in hepatocellular carcinoma.	1
In this study, we demonstrate that pre-treatment of the sensitive cancer cell lines (e.g., LOXIMVI, A375, TPC-1 and BCPAP) with a B-Raf or MEK inhibitor downregulates death receptor 5 expression and impedes the response of these cancer cell lines to TRAIL- or AMG655-induced apoptosis, implying a potential negative impact of B-Raf- or MEK-targeted cancer therapy on the therapeutic efficacy of TRAIL- or death receptor 5-based cancer therapy.	1
Our data support the possibility that the effects observed with the p27threonine 198A mutant do not reflect a lack of phosphorylation but the presence of a small residue in the last position of p27 protein that may alter the natural unstable and unstructured conformation of p27 C-terminal tail , .	2
It has been reported that Gab2 regulates cytoskeletal organization and migration of mammary epithelial cells by modulating RhoA activation [ ].	1
For Ingenuity Pathways Analysis, we used a Fisher's exact test to calculate a p-value to determine the probability that the biological function assigned to that network could be explained by chance alone.	3
Here we demonstrate that activated EphB1 recruits the adaptor proteins Grb2 and p52Shc and promotes p52Shc and c-Src tyrosine phosphorylation as well as MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation.	1
Our previous data indicated that 14-3-3ζ overexpression led to increased Akt phosphorylation and transformation of the non-transformed MCF-10A human mammary epithelial cells, suggesting 14-3-3ζ may be involved in breast cancer development ( ; ).	2
RasV12-induced, but not RacQL-induced, ruffles were efficiently inhibited by the coexpression of E3b1DY, but not of E3b1 wild type ( ), supporting the contention that the ability of E3b1 to form a complex with Eps8 is required to transmit signals from Ras to Rac.	1
To determine whether Fyn or Lck could phosphorylate Pyk2, we immunoprecipitated the kinase-inactive Pyk2 mutant, PKM ( ), that had been transfected into COS-7 cells and subjected it to kinase reactions in vitro with either purified Fyn or Lck (Fig. D).	3
However, our previous work revealed that E-cadherin levels do not decrease in the presence of SRC activation by CSF-1R in MCF-10As, but rather E-cadherin is redistributed to intracellular vesicles.	2
The results showed that the N-terminus of Orf virus-encoded protein 002 plays a crucial role in inhibiting both the acetylation and phosphorylation of NF-κB p65.	1
In contrast, our findings suggest that Chibby phosphorylation by Akt facilitates 14-3-3 binding followed by nuclear export of β-catenin, leading to inhibition of β-catenin signaling.	2
Consistent with the latter hypothesis, translocation of CFP-Kras-tail was not affected by coexpression of a mutant of dynamin-1 (DynK44A) deficient in GTP binding and hydrolysis that efficiently blocks clathrin- ( ) and caveolae-mediated endocytosis ( ) ( ).	2
In particular, several studies suggest that integrins are involved in uPAR signaling.	2
However, we do not rule out that other sites may also contribute to overall 14-3-3 binding.	2
We found that the NCI-H1915 cell line had no detectable phosphorylation levels of AKT Ser 473 despite strong expression of basal AKT (Figure ).	1
Nonetheless, the knockdown experiments confirm a role for MED14 in mitogen induction of immediate early genes, albeit with the caveat that MED14 depletion may have pleiotropic effects on Mediator structure and composition.	2
In the present study, our findings suggest that the increased cytosolic level of cytochrome c subsequently activates caspase 9.	2
We have demonstrated previously that Shp2 is a component of the AKAP-Lbc complex ( ).	1
These results suggest that receptor hyperphosphorylation occurs in the absence of HER2, but declines rapidly due to degradation.	2
They provide evidence that p21-activated kinase is involved in the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-AKT pathway as a scaffolding protein.	1
However, the fact that P*S1466//S1466 is detected at centrosomes but not cell-cell adhesions ( ) indicates that the P*Tiam1-Rac-Pak complex acts from the centrosomes.	1
A structural feature unique to PRL PTPs is that they form non-covalent trimers in vitro and in vivo , , suggesting that quaternary interactions may be required for full catalytic activity, and that disruption of this structure, possibly through phosphorylation, may affect function.	2
We found that a constitutively active MEK5 mutant phosphorylated ERK5 at the TEY motif, resulting in the sequential autophosphorylation of multiple C-terminal residues, including Thr732 and Ser769/773/775.	1
We speculate that upregulation of Bam32 during the germinal center response may lead to qualitative changes in B cell antigen receptor signaling to the nucleus necessary for the exquisitely sensitive process of selection based on affinity for antigen.	2
We also found that fangchinoline promotes SGC7901 apoptosis by decreasing Bcl-2 level and increasing caspase-3, caspase-9 expression.	1
Previous studies have shown that total Net1 activity is upregulated in response to extracellular stimuli that cause DNA damage, such as ionizing radiation .	1
The subtle defect in phospholipase C phosphorylation in the 2YF, which might be more impressive were it not for the twofold-higher level of protein expression ( C) and the more complete block in the 3YF, indicates that, in addition to the predicted phospholipase C-γ site at Y136, the Grb2-binding sites in linker for activation of T cells are also essential for phospholipase C-γ1.	3
These results suggest that BMP9 significantly suppresses the migration and metastasis abilities of SK-BR-3 cells.	2
We previously reported the surprising finding that inhibition or knockdown of Abl family kinases enhanced transformation of mouse fibroblasts by CrkI.	1
Whereas targeting mutant KRAS remained difficult, several studies demonstrated that NRAS mutations can be targeted by inhibition of MEK in tumor cell lines [ , , ].	1
However, to confirm that Shp2 is responsible for the dephosphorylation of FGFR2 in the absence of Grb2, we measured the effect of a Shp2 inhibitor (NSC87877) on the phosphorylated FGFR2 level in HEK293T cells in which Grb2 had been knocked down ( ).	1
Thus, our results suggest that the mTOR signaling pathway also modulates the E-cadherin levels in Slug-independent manner.	2
We found that 14-3-3ζ enhances, whereas 14-3-3η and ε isoforms repress, β-catenin activation of the TopFlash reporter ( ).	1
It has been reported that the tyrosine kinases Src and Abl phosphorylate protein kinase D1 ( ), suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation within the pleckstrin homology domain of protein kinase D1 induces a conformational change, promoting PKCδ recruitment and leading to activation of protein kinase D1.	2
Our data indicate that inhibition of CXCR2 and CXCR4 together or inhibition of either receptor combined with inhibitors of MEK and/or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase may be useful in inhibiting the metastasis of CXCR4- and CXCR2-expressing breast cancers.	2
However, tyrosine phosphorylation on the EGFR mutants could be further increased by EGF stimulation ( B), suggesting that the mutant EGFRs exhibit both ligand-independent and ligand-dependent activation, similar to that observed upon EGF stimulation of the L858R mutant H3255 lung adenocarcinoma cell line [ ].	3
This may be explained by the fact that increased RAS expression does not necessarily lead to increased levels of RAS-GTP in cells.	2
We and others have previously reported identification and characterization of CARP-1/CCAR1 that is a novel and biphasic transducer of cell growth and apoptosis signaling.	1
As shown in (B), knockdown of PAK4 expression reversed CDDP resistance as the cytotoxicity of CDDP in PAK4 silencing by RNA interference-tranfected AGS/CDDP cells and MKN-45/CDDP cells was comparable with that in AGS and MKN-45 cells after 48-h incubation.	1
This demonstrates that expression of Dok1 mutants that cannot be phosphorylated at sites 295 and 361 exerts a dominant-negative (pro-oncogenic) effect over endogenous Dok1.	1
By inference, the protection of p110β-RAS-binding domain-DM mice against bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, together with the reduced migration of p110β-RAS-binding domain-DM fibroblasts in lysophosphatidic acid-gradients, suggests that p110β activation downstream of lysophosphatidic acid might be critical for fibroblast chemotaxis to sites of tissue damage in vivo.	3
The results also do not necessarily imply that all tumors having high phospho-AKT levels would possess p53-R273H mutation and have the same degree of resistance to apoptosis and anoikis.	2
Finally, we show that ARNT knockdown not only affects accumulation of mRNA and protein of estrogen receptorα-target genes, but also has phenotypic consequences by influencing estrogen receptorα-mediated cell proliferation.	1
Furthermore, we show that Ret9 but not Ret51 induces epithelial cells to form branched tubular structures in three-dimensional cultures in a Shank3-dependent manner.	1
Previous studies have shown that the polybasic region of Rac1 is important for its nuclear localization , .	1
Other studies verify this involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinase in antibiotic-associated nephrotoxicity; p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase has been found to be upregulated in rat kidneys following gentamicin treatment, and it has been shown that combination treatment with the lipid-lowering drug, atorvastatin, ameliorated gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity, through inhibition of p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-κB expression [ ].	1
Although phosphorylation of SRC at its activation site (Y418) was not detected in cells expressing either form of CSF-1R, constitutively active variant of CSF-1R was highly phosphorylated at Y561 indicating that this site is competent to recruit and activate SRC.	1
S1 shows that overexpression of 14-3-3ζ or DN-14-3-3ζ does not affect Chibby protein levels.	1
These results indicated that a submicromolar concentration of As2O3 is capable of inhibiting myoblast differentiation and myotube formation.	1
Our group recently has demonstrated that metformin and gefitinib are synergistic in LKB1-wild-type NSCLC cells.	1
Our current study suggests that enhanced angiogenesis by KLF5 loss is likely another mechanism for the tumor promoting effect of KLF5 loss during prostatic tumorigenesis initiated by other oncogenic factors, which is in addition to its previously reported promoting function in tumor cell proliferation [ ].	2
Of note, we found that the biological function of the combination of TAK165 and all-trans retinoic acid in inducing cell differentiation is driven by the activation of the RARα/STAT1 axis resulting from MEK/ERK phosphorylation instead of HER2 inhibition.	1
In addition, our studies suggest that FGF2 exerts its effects in human ovarian cancer cells via the activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt/mTOR and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways and the subsequent increased expression of Slug and ZEB1.	2
Most part of the recent literature suggests that in the N-terminal portion of the protein resides the ability of p27 to bind and inhibit the activity of several cyclin/CDKs complexes while its C-terminal domain seems to control protein stability, nuclear localization and binding to non-CDKs complexes .	2
These results suggest that c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of N-Ras promotes SHP2 recruitment to tyrosyl phosphorylated N-Ras.	2
Since phosphorylated Net1 is inactive , it is likely that activation of Net1 involves dephosphorylation by a phosphatase, which itself could be activated by several different kinases stimulated by ionizing radiation.	3
Alternatively, mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 may indeed act via indirect means through activation of downstream kinases that in turn regulate Smad2/3 linker phosphorylation; however, such kinases remain to be identified.	2
Consistent with this, there was substantial phosphorylation of Ser491//S491 in a human α2β2γ1 complex, and slight phosphorylation of Ser487 in a human α1β2γ1 complex, when they were incubated with MgATP alone; these effects were completely abolished by D157A mutations that rendered the complexes inactive, although Ser487 could still be phosphorylated by Akt in the inactive complex ( B).	3
We have previously shown that extracellular signal-regulated kinases [ERK, consisting of p44 (ERK1) and p42 (ERK2)] phosphorylates 108T of Rac1 in response to EGF stimulation [ ].	1
In contrast, we find that Gab2 expression increases Zeb1 expression ( and ) without affecting the expression of Slug, Snail, and Twist (Data not shown).	1
Although the function we have described here for Tiam1-Pak-Rac signalling could contribute to cell growth through promoting mitotic progression, perhaps more important is the possibility that loss of Tiam1 or Pak1/2, or de-regulation of Tiam1 S1466 phosphorylation could lead to chromosome mis-segregation, which could in turn promote malignant progression.	3
In this study, we showed that TAK165, a HER2 inhibitor, exhibited a strong synergy with all-trans retinoic acid to promote acute myeloid leukemia cell differentiation.	1
This central network role also agrees with that suggested by results from arsenic-induced skin tumors ( ) and from hepatocellular carcinoma induced by in utero arsenic exposure ( ).	2
For example, showed that in some cell types, these kinases are able to compensate for the loss of the other related kinases.	1
The polybasic region of RhoA interacts strongly with RhoGDI, an association that keeps RhoA sequestered in the cytosol of cells and away from membranes where it is active .	1
Although many kinases including Erk (extracellular-signal-regulated kinases), p38 and CDK (cyclin-dependent kinase) have been shown to phosphorylate Smad2/3 linker residues , inhibitors that specifically target these kinases were less effective in suppressing T220/T179 phosphorylation when compared with LY ( ; ).	1
These data demonstrate that RICTOR-mTOR is the primary PDK2 activated by β1 integrins. (A) HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA directed against RICTOR and then allowed to adhere to plates coated with invasin (β1 integrin-ligand) or Pluronic (non-adhesive control) for 60 min. 	1
Time course analysis showed that p52Shc tyrosine phosphorylation was an early event, taking place already 2 min after EphB1 activation ( C).	1
Our data show that PRL-3 is phosphorylated downstream of Src ( , and ), that Y53 is the major site of tyrosine phosphorylation ( ) and that Y53 is required for full promotion of invasion ( ), presumably because Y53 must be phosphorylated.	1
Interestingly, our data show that JNK1 and 2 respond differently to plating on fibronectin and collagen ( D).	1
In the current study, we have advanced these atomic force microscopy techniques to allow for dynamic measurement of biophysical properties in living cells and now demonstrate that c-Abl expression is also required for sphingosine 1-phosphate to alter the elastic modulus across the cell ( ).	1
Finally, the observation that talazoparib combines more than additively with BKM-120 in animal models of Small cell lung cancer provides a strong rationale for the rapid advancement of clinical studies co-targeting PARP and PI3K (or AKT) in these cancers.	1
These results suggest that RAF inhibitors will inhibit the growth of tumors with mutant BRAF, but not those with wild-type BRAF, including those with RAS mutation.	2
The pattern that emerges from this earlier work is that protein phosphorylation may serve a specific role in signal modulation of Rho family GTPases by altering binding interactions with upstream regulators, with GTP, and with Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor.	2
Although using overexpressed nmMLCK for these experiments introduces potential artifact, these results strongly suggest that the association of c-Abl, nmMLCK, and cortactin is increased in ECs during sphingosine 1-phosphate-induced barrier enhancement.	2
The activity of the three AMP-activated protein kinase kinase preparations was not significantly affected by the direct addition of phenformin to the assays up to 1 mM concentration, although concentrations above that started to inhibit AMP-activated protein kinase kinase activity (not shown).	1
Together, these results suggest that the F395C mutant was unable to specifically interact with p53 and thus unable to recruit the PP2A core to p53.	2
This suggests that P-REX1 promotes IGF-1Rβ/InsRβ activation independently of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT activity.	2
In an earlier in vitro experiment we demonstrated that Shp2-mediated dephosphorylation of the FGFR2 activation loop tyrosine residues occurs only in the absence of Grb2 ( ).	1
The 3-fold increase in GTP loading on Rac1-Y64F as compared with the wild type may be due in part to the fact that the Rac1-Y64F mutant binds more efficiently with Rac1-associated GEFs ( ).	2
When tumours reached 80-100 mm3, all the mice were received CDDP administration (10 mg/kg per two times per week, i.p.). (A) showed that before CDDP administration, the levels of PAK4 were significantly higher in AGS/CDDP tumour tissues than those in AGS group.	1
In addition, the S370A, S380A/T382A/T383A and S385A mutations in PTEN did not significantly interfere with the binding of NDRG2 ( ), suggesting that NDRG2 can bind to both the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of PTEN.	2
To confirm that Tyr490//Y490 is indeed a substrate for Src phosphorylation, we mutated this residue to Ala using site-directed mutagenesis.	2
We therefore considered whether CrkI overexpression might induce localized differences in Ras activity that were not evident in total cell lysates.	3
We then demonstrated that the fibronectin/FAK survival signal suppresses an apoptosis pathway regulated by the tumor suppressor p53 in fibroblasts and endothelial cells ( ).	1
It is believed that the negative charge induced by tyrosine phosphorylation at Y64//Y64 could stabilize the interaction with these two positively charged basic residues on Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor , .	3
Studies in breast cancer models using these methods have demonstrated that inhibition of SRC kinase activity suppresses phenotypic effects induced by the overexpression or activation of Receptor tyrosine kinases like EGFR and ERBB2, e.g. anchorage-independent growth, motility and survival , , , .	1
We then examined whether the full-length CFP-conjugated KRas protein translocates to intracellular membranes in response to glutamate. (a and b) shows that CFP-KRas undergoes glutamate-induced translocation to perinuclear membranes with kinetics indistinguishable to that of the KRas-tail probe (t1/2 ∼4.5 min).	1
We found that in Pten-null mouse prostate tumors, deletion of Klf5 significantly promoted angiogenesis, and conditioned media from human prostate cancer cells with modulated KLF5 expression affected tube formation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells .	1
Our results suggest that As2O3 inhibits myogenic differentiation by inhibiting Akt-regulated signaling.	2
Furthermore, the expression levels of SHIP1, a different class of lipid phosphatase that catalyses PIP3 to PI(3,4)P2 (ref. ), showed no significant differences between adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma cells and controls, although a few cases showed higher levels of SHIP1 ( ).	1
In addition, we have identified a novel nuclear transcription factor, Kaiso, which interacts directly with p120, suggesting that p120 may regulate transcriptional activity at some level ( ).	2
The demonstration that CXCR7, a receptor for CXCL12 and CXCL11, may be involved in breast cancer ( ) is intriguing, since this receptor has been postulated to be a decoy receptor ( ; ; ).	1
We also tested 14-3-3 binding to BAD and found that binding was dramatically decreased in mutants with serine 136A mutations ( ), indicating that serine 136 is the most important phosphorylation site for the BAD/14-3-3 complex formation as previously observed , .	1
This finding suggests that F395C mutant B56γ3 is no longer able to function as a p53-dependent tumor suppressor protein.	2
We show that ERK interacts with RhoA and that this interaction is dependent on the ERK docking site at the C-terminus of RhoA.	1
By comparison, treatment with a serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A did not result in increased tyrosyl-phosphorylated N-Ras(wild-type) ( ), suggesting that a tyrosine phosphatase actively dephosphorylates Ras.	2
The data above suggest that Elk-1-Mediator interactions involving MED23 may not be contingent on Elk-1 phosphorylation.	2
We have not identified an alternative pathway selectively driving viability/growth of cell lines that are resistant to MEK inhibition.	1
Furthermore, we found that association with 14-3-3 triggers cytoplasmic relocation of Chibby protein.	1
Studies with peptides have found that the preferred site of phosphorylation for Pak1 are peptides with basic amino acids R and K at positions -2 and -3 from the phosphorylated serine and a hydrophobic residue such as tyrosine at the +2 position.	1
However, it remains possible that other MAPK phosphatases of the dual-specificity phosphatase family could affect active Ras-induced Erk1/2 activity.	3
This result suggests that critical phosphatases are responsible for the modulation of specific molecular pathways within each subgroup.	2
Therefore, it may be reasonable that hypoxia-stimulated reactive oxygen species generation in breast cancer cell line MCF-7 is independent of Rac1 activation.	2
Nonetheless, the implication of our findings is that complementing HER2-targeted therapies with anti-EGFR drugs may be beneficial in HER2-positive breast cancer as also evidenced by recent clinical trials where the dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib was demonstrated to provide clinically beneficial results when administered in combination with anti-HER2 drugs such as herceptin ( ).	1
Taken together with the Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor data, these findings depict a pattern of negative regulation that is a precedented theme in signaling regulation by tyrosine kinases and has been demonstrated in the context of FAK interactions with endophilin A, Src, and MMP-14 .	1
The peptide was detected at 13.83 mins in the total ion chromatogram (C) with mass-to-charge ratio 647.8132, which represents an error of 0.38 ppm (D). (E) The tandem mass spectrum matched the sequence, VKEKATGRYpY indicating that the C-terminal tyrosine was phosphorylated; the detection of the phosphotyrosine y1 is consistent with this localization. (F) Alignment of AKT protein sequences revealed that tyrosine at 176 is invariant from yeast to humans and all the three known human AKT isoforms. (G) mouse embryonic fibroblast1&2KO cells expressing HA-tagged AKT or Y176F mutant were serum-starved (24 h), treated with EGF for 15 mins and lysates were IP with anti-Ack1 Abs followed by IB with anti-AKT antibodies (top panel).	1
The findings suggest that increases in RAS activation or RAF dimerization may be sufficient to cause drug resistance.	2
We have uncovered that growth factors binding to Receptor Tyrosine Kinases lead to activation of a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Ack1 (also known as ACK or TNK2), which directly phosphorylates AKT at an evolutionarily conserved tyrosine 176 in the kinase domain.	1
The latter result is not entirely unexpected, since we have recently observed that tyrosine-phosphorylated adaptor proteins like SKAP55 bind to the isolated src homology 2 domain of lck, whereas they do not associate with the kinase in intact cells ( , , ).	2
These observations suggest that combining PARP and PI3K inhibitors could be of therapeutic benefit beyond patients with PIK3CA mutant disease.	3
We have previously demonstrated that pp60src phosphorylation of nmMLCK significantly increases its binding to recombinant cortactin ( ).	1
Finally, the model suggests that promotion of RAF dimerization by elevation of wild-type RAF expression or RAS activity could lead to drug resistance in mutant BRAF tumors.	3
In support of a role for P-REX1 driving both the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways, we observed that high P-REX1 mRNA levels, but not phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation score (by gene expression) or P-AKTT308 level, are predictive of increased sensitivity to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors ( , ).	2
These results suggest that cancers harboring distinct activating kinase domain mutations of EGFR may exhibit a differential sensitivity to specific EGFR inhibitors.	2
The data showed that stimulation of SYF cells ectopically expressing chimeric VEGFR-2 (CKR) with ligand increases phosphorylation of Y1052.	1
We next sought to confirm that RasGAP binds to phosphorylated Dok1 in our cell system by expressing HA-tagged homolog of Dok1 and immunoprecipitating with anti-HA antibody.	2
We in fact confirmed that the threonine 198A substitution results in increased protein degradation, yet this is not dependent on the Threonine 187//T187 phosphorylation and it is not dependent on the binding with the Skp2 protein, as previously suggested .	2
Further, we demonstrated that FAM83B is required for EGFR/RAS-mediated transformation and is a critical component necessary for transmitting signals from activated RAS to downstream MAPK effectors.	1
Using this approach we demonstrated a strict requirement for association between Gab1 and p85 in EGF-induced phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase activation, suggesting that Gab1 indeed provides an essential link between the EGFR and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase.	1
On the other hand, our results suggest that phosphorylation of threonine 198//T198 has no effect on cell proliferation and p27 protein stability.	2
A recent study indicates that tyrosine 1057//Y1057 of VEGFR-2 also serves as a binding site for c-Cbl by directly interacting with its tyrosine kinase binding domain , raising an interesting possibility as to whether c-Cbl and c-Src competitively bind to Y1057 or c-Cbl acts to bridge c-Src to VEGFR-2 since c-Cbl is known to interact with c-Src via its SH3 domain .	1
In this study, we reported that hypoxia could induce HIF-1α and VEGF expression accompanied by Rac1 activation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.	3
Previous studies have shown that the polybasic region of Rac1 and several adjoining residues comprise a functional nuclear localization signals that is responsible for the nuclear localization of Rac1 , .	1
However, our results showed that decreased activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase or ERK by inhibitor did not change the activated hypoxia-inducible factor-1α mRNA transcription level under hypoxia in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells.	1
To further elucidate the molecular mechanisms of Rac1-Y64F enhancement of cell spreading, lamellipodial stability, and the targeting of Rac1 to focal adhesions, we studied Rac1 activity (e.g. GTP binding and not GTPase activity) in Mouse embryo fibroblast that were transfected with EGFP-Rac1-WT, or mutations that included Q61L, T17N, Y64D, or Y64F ( ).	1
This suggests that glucocorticoid receptor acetylation negatively regulates dexamethasone-induced repression of nuclear factor-κB-dependent gene expression.	2
Here, we show that SHP2 preferentially binds to and dephosphorylates tyrosyl phosphorylated Ras; an event that is required for the (re)activation of Ras and the continuation of Ras GTPase cycle.	1
Previous reports suggest that SHP2, the known positive effector of EGFR and HER2 signaling, interacts with EGFR and HER2 through Gab1 ( , ).	2
HER2 is a constitutively active protein ( ), a property that may be key to its oncogenicity.	2
It has been proposed that a wide variety of cytokines secreted by tumor cells such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) , basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), platelet-derived growth factor , erythropoietin , and insulin-like growth factor may stimulate angiogenesis.	2
Having shown that PRL-3 can be a direct substrate of Src tyrosine kinase activity in vitro and that endogenous PRL-3 is tyrosine phosphorylated in vivo, we wished to determine the role of Src in modulating PRL-3 phosphorylation.	2
Src is known to be a key regulator of invadopodia. , Cortactin, another protein that is necessary for invadopodia formation also was among the positives.	1
In our previous study , , we showed that HSP20 is expressed in the tumor tissues of human hepatocellular carcinoma.	1
Consistently, our data suggest that the combined treatment of metformin and MEK-Is interferes with the epithelia-to-mesenchymal transition process and distant metastatis spread.	2
Applying histological staining to Pten-null mouse prostates, we observed that deletion of Klf5 significantly increased the number of microvessels, accompanied by the upregulation of multiple angiogenesis-related genes based on microarray analysis with MetaCore software.	1
In addition, both phosphatidylinositol3K and SYNJ2 have been shown to be necessary for the formation of podosomes and invadopodia. , Importantly, we also showed that it is the 5'-phosphatase, but not Sac1 enzymatic activity of SYNJ2 that regulates invadopodia formation.	1
Together, these results show that the membrane targeting motif of KRas is necessary and sufficient for glutamate-induced translocation of the full-length GTPase, and that translocation is selective for KRas over HRas.	1
Given the diffuse and random nature of the gliomas that form in these mice, measuring overall volume is not an accurate or meaningful end point.	1
We therefore examined the effect of overexpressing CaMKKβ in HeLa cells in the absence of a Ca2+ ionophore. (A) shows that transient expression of CaMKKβ in the parental T-Rex™ HeLa cells caused almost as much activation of AMPK as stable expression of LKB1 in the same cell line, even without addition of A23187.	1
However, we confirmed here that B56γ1 is localized in nuclei by means of a confocal laser scanning microscopic study using the same anti-mouse B56γ1 antibody and the same animal species as those used by Ito et al. , .	1
Time-course analysis showed that the onset of death receptor 5 reduction occurred as early as 4 h post treatment and was sustained for up to 20 h ( ).	1
By subjecting a series of deletion mutants to co-immunoprecipitation assays, a domain containing a putative α-β hydrolase fold (NDR domain) that is conserved among NDRG family members was found to interact with the C-terminal half of PTEN, which contains a C2 lipid-binding domain ( ).	1
As both the KRas and Rap1a motifs consist of a prenyl moiety and a polybasic sequence (and are the only motifs to show this particular combination in our list), these data suggest that this combination represents the minimal membrane-interacting motif that drives translocation.	2
Using two different c-Raf siRNAs, we found that inhibiting c-Raf by knocking down its expression effectively abrogated the ability of PLX4032 to increase ERK phosphorylation and Death receptor 5 expression ( ).	1
The results presented in demonstrated that autophosphorylation of the EGFR and possibly HER2 on the c-Cbl and the major Grb2 binding sites is very low in the presence of HER2, eliminating the direct and indirect interaction of c-Cbl.	1
Previous studies have suggested that ErbB3 and Gab1 can function as links between EGFR and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase.	2
Similar affinities have been reported for the RAS-p110α and RAS-p110γ interactions ( ; ), indicating that RAC1 and CDC42 are plausible RAS-binding domain interactors of p110β.	1
Our data predict that combining CXCR4 antagonists with MEK inhibitors, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors, or CXCR2 inhibitors may offer therapeutic advantages for CXCR4-positive breast cancer.	2
Here, we investigate the role of threonine 198//T198 phosphorylation in cell growth and motility demonstrating that this event is important in the regulation of cell motility while it does not affect cell proliferation.	1
PTEN has been previously shown in cells cultured in soft agar, to suppress proliferation and colony formation ( ; ; ) and that this ability appeared to require lipid phosphatase activity.	1
In contrast, cells transfected with a control construct (with a point mutation in the Ras binding domain that abolishes sensor response), showed no polarized distribution of ratio values ( ).	1
Shank3 thus provides a platform for the regulated recruitment of additional effectors, such as Grb2, that are involved in stimulation of downstream signaling, although Shank3 may still be involved in integration of receptor complexes with the cytoskeleton.	2
Stratifying breast tumors by clinical estrogen receptor α status or molecular subtype, we found that P-REX1 protein and mRNA levels were significantly higher in estrogen receptor α+/luminal tumors compared with estrogen receptor α-/basal tumors, and compared with a diversity of other tumor subtypes ( , ).	1
Together, these experiments show that the KRas and Rap1a plasma membrane targeting motifs regulate translocation of a reporter protein to intracellular membranes in response to neuronal stimulation.	1
In our recent study, expression profiling and MetaCore analysis of mouse dorsal prostates at 6 months in the Pten-null background indicated that the process of blood morphogenesis is the most enriched upon the deletion of Klf5 [ ], composed of 39 differentially expressed genes.	1
Our data have shown that Akt does not affect phosphorylation of Smad2/3-T220/T179, which is consistent with previous findings .	1
Considering this, it seems possible that the importance of PTEN's protein phosphatase activity may have been underestimated.	2
Together, the results in and suggest that, after B cell antigen receptor ligation, Bam32 is recruited to the plasma membrane at sites of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation through binding to PI(3,4,5)P3 in a manner analogous to Btk.	2
Here, we show that tyrosyl-phosphorylated Ras binds to and is dephosphorylated by SHP2, which in turn promotes Ras binding to Raf and the activation of downstream Ras/ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling.	1
As shown in A, the level of association between the linker for activation of T cells-WT molecule expressed in linker for activation of T cells-/- Bone marrow-derived mast cells and Grb2 was comparable to that of endogenous linker for activation of T cells and Grb2 in activated linker for activation of T cells+/+ Bone marrow-derived mast cells.	1
Note that higher molecular weight forms of pp29/30 are detectable in antiphosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates prepared from Pervanadate-treated but not from unstimulated HPB-ALL cells (Fig. A, PTYR lanes).	1
Because it is already known that pharmacological activation of AMP-activated protein kinase causes a general inhibition of biosynthesis, as well as a p53-dependent arrest in G1 phase of the cell cycle, activation of AMP-activated protein kinase by LKB1 might explain, at least in part, the ability of LKB1 to act as a tumor suppressor.	3
These results suggest that Bam32 expression levels are modulated during B cell activation and differentiation.	2
Although we cannot exclude that the NH2-terminal region of E3b1-Abi-1 participates in binding, in vivo, we were not able to observe a high-affinity binding surface in that region by in vitro binding experiments ( A; ).	3
It has also been found that PP2A with members of the B56 family can dephosphorylate ERK directly, and that this action is related to cell migration.	2

Figure shows that neither 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside nor phenformin activated AMP-activated protein kinase above the basal level in control HeLa cells.	1
Furthermore, annexin V/PI analysis showed that TAS-116 in combination with AZD6244 enhanced apoptosis compared with TAS-116 or AZD6244 monotherapy (P < 0.01, respectively, in both NCI-H929 and myeloma.1S cell lines), even with bone marrow stromal cell supernatant (P < 0.05, respectively, in both cell lines) ( ).	1
Nuclear levels of both receptor and linker region phosphorylated smad 2 increased with inhibition of proteosomal degradation, consistent with previous data showing nuclear proteosomal degradation of smads , but suggested that linker region phosphorylation may be associated with directing smads to proteosomal degradation .	2
It is noteworthy that the role of PI3K-Akt kinase signaling in mediating Ras-mediated activation of SAF-1 has not been examined and awaits further investigation.	3
We also demonstrate that the Ret9 isoform, and not Ret51, is able to induce the formation of tubular structures of kidney epithelial cells in three-dimensional culture, and that this ability is dependent on interaction with Shank3.	1
The reduced Shc interaction may be related to low Grb2 binding in the HER2 cells; note that Shc proteins are known to also make indirect interaction with receptor tyrosine kinases through Grb2( , ).	2
We found that the p53-R273 contact mutant, but not the p53-R175 conformational mutant, promotes cancer cell survival and resistance to anoikis of cancer cells.	1
Group I p21-activated kinases are known to be active on mitotic centrosomes and a few studies report that Pak1/2 contribute to proper timing of the G2/M transition .	1
It has been previously shown that co-expression with β and γ subunits greatly increases expression of GST-tagged α1 in COS7 cells, most likely because the heterotrimeric complex is more stable and is degraded less rapidly [ ].	1
In addition, phosphorylation of ACK, calmodulin, EPHA2, integrin β4, intersectin 2, KIRREL, HGF-R, GAB1, CDC2, ERK2, annexin A2, and PI3-K p85-beta were induced by CSF-1R and identified in at least one of the other three proteomic datasets analyzed for Receptor tyrosine kinase-induced tyrosine phosphorylation indicating that their phosphorylation is not unique to CSF-1R.	1
In this study, we demonstrated that TAS-116 potently induces cytotoxicity and significantly inhibits rat sarcoma-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway client proteins in NRAS- or KRAS-mutated myeloma cell lines.	1
In the case of AMPK it was proposed that phosphorylation of Ser487 on rat AMPK-α1 might promote phosphorylation of Thr481, although not by conventional priming because the residue spacing is not appropriate, and because phosphorylation was not affected by a GSK3β mutation that reduces phosphorylation of primed substrates [ ].	3
Thus, we have discovered an important mechanism of resistance to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase α-specific inhibition and propose that the combination of the described inhibitors may be more efficacious in treating human breast tumors than any of the single agents.	2
S3 (top) shows that ephrinB2/Fc stimulation increases integrin-induced ERK1/2 activation and (bottom) that ephrinB2/Fc stimulation does not inhibit VEGF-induced ERK activation.	1
These observations confirmed our in vitro findings that RLIP76 depletion induces potent anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in pancreatic cancers.	1
Previous studies of the kinase activity of LKB1, whether utilizing autophosphorylation [ ], or p53 [ ] or myelin basic protein [ ] as substrates, had used MnATP as co-substrate and had reported that there was no activity with the more physiological MgATP complex.	1
We showed that ligand stimulation of EphB1 resulted in its association with the adaptor proteins Grb2 and p52Shc ( A).	1
This synergistic effect was less obvious in EGFR mutated tumor models that may be due to endogenous AMPK activity and solely EGFR TKI (Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor) sensitivity.	2
In Small cell lung cancer however where BRCA mutations are rare (1-3.5% [ , ]), we have previously shown that resistance to PARP inhibition to be correlated to activation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway [ ].	1
Analysis of the efficiency of the cell lysis conditions used for immunoprecipitation (Triton X-100 based) showed that the pellet fraction obtained after centrifugation of the cell lysate did not contain detectable amounts of AKT phospho-Ser473 ( ), and thus most of the phosphorylated AKT after β1 integrin-stimulation was present in the soluble fraction ( ).	1
These 29-31 kDa acidic proteins bind to phosphorylated serine/threonine motifs on target proteins ( ; ). 14-3-3 proteins do not possess any catalytic activity; however, they exert their effect by modulating subcellular localization or catalytic activity of target proteins and by mediating formation of protein complexes ( ). 14-3-3 proteins interact with many proteins that potentially regulate a diverse number of cellular processes ( ; ; ).	1
Better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms that promote phosphoinositide 3-kinase activation will bring essential insight into phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling in normal and cancer cells which may facilitate development of effective targeting strategies.	2
In summary, we show that inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase using different small molecule inhibitors potently suppresses the growth of breast cancer cells via inhibiting cell cycle and that this response is Forkhead box O protein dependent and p53 independent.	1
Emerging evidence suggests that these pathways are involved in the regulation of E-cadherin , .	2
For example, demonstrated that in both P19 and human renal microvascular endothelial cells expressing high levels of EphB1, EphB1 receptor discriminates between different oligomeric forms of ephrinB1/Fc to determine alternative signaling complexes, attachment, and assembly responses.	1
We also showed that the phosphomimetic mutant GFP-RhoA S88E/T100E has a similar level of nuclear localization with or without EGF stimulation, as does the non-phosphorylated mutant GFP-RhoA S88A/T100A ( ).	1
Likewise, the confocal microscopy results showed that SB202190 and WM at 10 μM significantly enhanced danusertib-induced autophagy compared with the control cells treated with danusertib alone ( ).	1
Moreover, we found that the TAK165- and all-trans retinoic acid- induced STAT1 activation was MEK/ERK dependent.	1
These findings indicated that the activation of RARα is critical for acute myeloid leukemia cells differentiation induced by the treatment of a combination of TAK165 and all-trans retinoic acid.	1
We and others have previously shown that NRAS or KRAS mutation contributes to resistance to conventional chemotherapy or bortezomib [ , ].	1

However, interaction studies in yeast suggest that the serine-proline-rich domain nestles between regions of MED14 with which diverse submodules interact.	2
In contrast to the activation of Rac by HGF, we found that sustained Ras signaling in subclones and populations of RasV12-transformed MDCK cells resulted in a permanent downregulation of Rac activity ( b).	1
Our previous studies have demonstrated that Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling increases CHOP- and Elk-dependent Death receptor 5 expression .	1
We also found that both phosphorylated and total Akt was reduced with 10 and 20 μM sorafenib.	1
Initial experiments transducing U87MG cells with simultaneously prepared virus preparations encoding GFP or PTEN indicated that even at low levels of virus at which resultant PTEN expression was approximately that of several cultured cell lines (around 1% culture volume), expression of GFP appeared relatively homogeneous and evident in at least 95% of the target cell populations.	1
The resulting increase in mRNA accumulation, protein expression and E2-inducible proliferation strongly suggests that ARNT acts as a transcriptional co-repressor in this cell line.	2
In these cell lines, especially NCI-H929 cells, we observed that a modest reduction in p-B-Raf, marked induction of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and inhibition of p-Akt were induced by TAS-116 in a dose-dependent manner ( ).	2
Nevertheless, our results are consistent with the results by Shiota et al. , which showed that alternative PDK2s exist beside TORC2 since residual Ser473-phosphorylated AKT was detected in RICTOR knockout mouse embryos.	1
In terms of tumorigenic function, we showed that the mutant protein has lost its ability to mediate the p53-dependent tumor suppressive function of PP2A.	1
The clinically achievable concentration of PLX4032 in plasma is over 80 μM and is 2-6 μM for AZD6244. , We observed that these inhibitors effectively inhibit death receptor 5 expression at these clinically relevant doses in our preclinical models ( ).	1
Conversely, the Sos-1-E3b1-Eps8 complex is stable under the same conditions, and may account, at least in part, for the prolonged activation of Rac signaling ( , A-D) and ruffling activity ( ; unpublished data) ( shows a proposed mode of action of Sos-1) The shift in catalytic specificity of Sos-1, upon interaction with Eps8 and E3b1 does not exclude the possibility that additional mechanisms might participate in its action on Rac in vivo.	2
It has been confirmed that phosphorylated NF-κB p65 could recruit the transcriptional co-activators such as p300 and CBP to the nuclear factors κB-bound promoter and facilitate DNA binding ability of NF-κB p65 - .	3
These studies show that in an ectopic uPAR expression system and in three different tumor cell lines expressing endogenous uPAR, silencing DOCK180 results in reduced Rac activation.	1
In summary, our data suggested that TAK165 promotes all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation by activating the MEK/ERK-mediated RARα/STAT1 axis.	2
The importance of JNK activation for the fibronectin-FAK survival pathway was confirmed by demonstrating that embryoid bodies derived from MKK4-null embryo stem cells, like embryoid bodies derived from FAK-null embryo stem cells ( ), displayed high levels of apoptosis when serum was withdrawn, whereas embryoid bodies from wild-type counterparts did not.	1
The data demonstrate that VEGF stimulates c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation at Y700, a site involved in the recruitment of VAV, GEF specific for Rho-family GTPases (Miura-Shimura et al., 2003) and Y774, a site along with Y700, involved in the Crk binding to c-Cbl ( ) ( ).	1
Although this mutation has not previously been described, its location suggests that it could also be an activating mutation.	3
These data indicated that 14-3-3ζ expression played an important role in Akt activation in cancer cells.	1
In particular, expression of the tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitory protein 3-interacting proteins (TNIP) 1 and 2 [also known as A20-binding inhibitor of NF-κB activation (ABIN) 1 and 2], as well as the nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor beta (NFκBIB, also known as IκBβ) were up-regulated suggesting that the CARP-1 functional mimetic-4 treatment likely affected the NF-κB-dependent survival signaling in Medulloblastoma cells.	2
Importantly, western blotting showed that TAS-116 in combination with AZD6244 enhanced cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspase 3 in KRAS-mutated myeloma.1S cells, in the presence or absence of bone marrow stromal cell supernatant ( ).	1
This provides a potential docking system for the Rac-based signaling machinery and argues that differential localization of adaptor molecules may further participate in the regulation of Sos-1 biological activities.	2
Interestingly, although MCF-7 cells harbor an activating mutation in exon 9 of p110 that makes phosphoinositide 3-kinase activation independent of p85, our data showed that mutation of serine 83 on p85 could still reduce phosphoinositide 3-kinase membrane localization and activation in MCF-7 cells.	3
Although β1 integrin-dependent ERK activation was required for surface expression of β3 integrin, immunoblotting showed that uPAR expression, β1 integrin knockdown, or inhibition of ERK activation did not affect total cell levels of β3 integrin ( ).	1
These data show that expression of uPAR promotes signaling through β3 integrin to drive tyrosine phosphorylation of the p130Cas substrate domain and formation of the p130Cas-CrkII adaptor complex.	1
Indeed, it appears that p53 is phosphorylated on serine 15 by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), also called FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein , a protein from the PIKK family that previously has been suggested to serve as a master regulator of the balance between protein synthesis and degradation , thereby participating in the control of cell size and perhaps in oncogenic transformation .	2
However, the phosphorylation state of phosphorylated Grb2 C-terminal SH3 domain Y209F is not affected by Shp2, suggesting that the Y209 is the target of Shp2.	2
The results showed that danusertib had potent growth-inhibitory, apoptosis-inducing, and autophagy-inducing effects on AGS and NCI-N78 cells.	1
Because c-Abl is capable of phosphorylating the cortactin present in this reaction, the possibility exists that a portion of the effects of c-Abl activity in this assay may be due to phosphorylation of cortactin rather than nmMLCK.	2
Here we demonstrate that CXCR4 expression induced expression of CXCR2 and ligands for CXCR2 in 3D rBM cultures.	1
These observations suggest that the activation of MEK (or other compensatory/escape pathways) may be more important than basal PI3K pathway activity in determining sensitivity to PI3K inhibition.	2
S4 shows that silencing of β integrin subunits in BE colon carcinoma cells affects cell morphology.	1
It has also been reported that a significant number of LKB1+/- mice over 50 weeks of age develop hepatocellular carcinomas that are associated with loss of LKB1 expression [ ].	1
In the present study, we show that TAS-116 triggers significant synergistic anti-myeloma effects when used in combination with a rat sarcoma-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway inhibitor.	1
A recent study suggested that the ERM proteins (ezrin, radixin, moesin) may play critical role in recruiting SOS to Ras ( ), which may also be functional in HER2 signaling.	2
Recent findings have suggested that additional regulatory mechanisms such as post-transcriptional regulation by microRNAs [ ], ubiquitination [ ], palmitoylation [ ], and phosphorylation [ ] might contribute further to the tight regulation of Rho GTPases.	3
First, we demonstrated identical effects with the equivalent site (Ser487)//S487 on the human α1β2γ1 complex ( F and ), showing that the effect is conserved in humans and is also independent of the β subunit isoform.	1
S3 shows that uPAR-driven Rac activity in 293T cells requires β3 integrin-dependent Src activation.	1
Reprobing for EGFR showed that it was stabilized in the HER2 cells and rapidly degraded in the controls ( ), which is consistent with previous reports ( , , ).	1
Our findings suggest that some feature of the structure of the ARKs, other than the primary sequence of the activation loop, may be required to determine this specificity.	2
We found that both B-Raf (e.g., PLX4032) and MEK inhibitors (e.g., AZD6244 and PD0325901) effectively inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation and reduced death receptor 5 levels in both human thyroid cancer and melanoma cells.	1
A recent study showed that metformin prevents tobacco-induced carcinogenesis in mice with 72% decrease in tumor burden [ ].	1
These data suggest that T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule is capable of recruiting p85 to the plasma membrane after T Cell Receptor-mediated activation of T lymphocytes.	2
Therefore, although induction of cardiac hypertrophy is a multifaceted process, inhibition of Shp2 activity through AKAP-Lbc-anchored PKA is a previously unrecognized mechanism that may promote this compensatory response.	2
We show that SAF-1 is a direct transcriptional regulator of H-Ras and K-Ras and overexpression of SAF-1 increases H-Ras and K-Ras gene expression.	1
This experiment proves that (in the presence of STRADα and mouse protein 25-α) LKB1 is sufficient for AMP-activated protein kinase activation, but does not prove that it is necessary, because expression of upstream kinases other than LKB1 might also be defective in HeLa cells.	3
In support of our conclusion, previous reports have also shown that Grb2 mediates receptor degradation by recruiting c-Cbl ( , ).	1
These data demonstrate that, unlike the case with Pak1, PKA does not stimulate serine 112 phosphorylation through Raf-1 and most likely phosphorylates BAD directly at serine 112. (A) Effects of kinase inhibitors on BAD serine 112 phosphorylation. 293T cells were co-transfected with expression vectors encoding full length wild-type BAD and Pak1 (kinase dead Pak1 or T423E). 24 hr after transfection, cells were starved for 16 hr and treated with GW5074 (5 µM), PD098059 (20 µM), Rapamycin (5 µM) or H89 (5 µM) for 2.5 hr as indicated.	1
Prior evidence indicates that pleckstrin homology domain binding to PIP3 may increase GTPase (i.e., Rac) binding activity of the DH domain in GEFs, although this remains controversial and may differ between GEFs (reviewed in ref. [ ]).	2
In agreement with this prediction, RAF inhibitors do not inhibit ERK signaling in cells that coexpress BRAFV600E and mutant RAS.	1
As controls, we showed that EGF stimulated ERK activation and this ERK activation is abolished in the presence of U0126 ( ).	1
The reduction of BAD upon treatment with IPA-3 was more pronounced upon longer exposure to IPA-3 suggesting that Pak1 may also affect the stability of BAD (data not shown). (A) BAD serine 111 phosphorylation was observed in a lung cancer cell line H358 and the malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor cell lines 90-8 and STS26. (B) Effects of protein kinase inhibitors on BAD serine 111 and serine 112 phosphorylation.	2
Notably, inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated ruffles could also be caused by microinjection of anti-Abi1 antibodies ( and Fig. S4), which, however, did not affect TPA-induced actin remodeling, indicating that additional pathways leading to Rac activation (and possibly reflecting the simultaneous presence of several Rac GEFs in the cells) are at play (supplemental information, ).	3
The images from which that surface plot is derived are shown in Fig.	1
It is well known that PTEN is a lipid phosphatase whose loss activates PI3K/AKT signaling [ ], which is related to hypoxia inducible factor 1α upregulation and enhanced angiogenesis in some human cancer cells [ , ].	1
These data indicate that CFP-KRas-tail translocation is unlikely to be an endocytic event, and suggest that translocation occurs via a diffusion-based shuttling mechanism through the cytoplasm.	3
These results strongly suggest that PLX4032-induced ERK activation and Death receptor 5 upregulation is dependent on the presence of mutant Ras gene.	2
Previous studies have shown that activation of oncogenic Ras leads to generation of CD24-/CD44+ stem-like cells from CD24+/CD44low cells (Morel et al., ).	1
Our results suggest that clinical trials to test the efficacy of metformin for cancer treatment might be targeted at specific classes of tumour, such as those in which Akt is hyper-activated.	3
As shown, VEGF stimulation of wild type and c-Cbl null cells induced time-dependent down regulation of VEGFR-2 ( ), suggesting that c-Cbl activity is not required for downregulation of VEGFR-2 as previously reported ( ).	2
These results suggest that the molecular mode of action linking MAP3K2 methylation to MEK1/2 activation is not due to changes in the intrinsic kinase activity of MAP3K2 but rather another mechanism.	2
Taken together, the findings reported here are consistent with a possible mode of cross-talk between two cytoskeletal regulating mechanisms that are turned on by integrin engagement during the early phases of cell attachment and spreading on extracellular matrix: the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases Src and FAK, and the Rho family member Rac1.	2
It should also be pointed out that the concentration of CaMKKα used to phosphorylate BRSK1 in was approx. 20-fold higher than that required to obtain a comparable level of phosphorylation of AMPK-α1 (results not shown).	1
Hence, it is safe to expect that sustained treatment of patients with these B-Raf or MEK inhibitors in the clinic may result in drastic downregulation or depletion of death receptor 5 expression in cancer tissues.	2
The observations made here that PARP inhibition increased PI3K/mTOR signaling, in combination with our previous report that Small cell lung cancer cell lines with higher PI3K/mTOR activity are less sensitive to PARP inhibitor talazoparib, suggest that this pathway is a both a marker of inherent resistance and a potential mechanism of acquired resistance to PARP inhibition.	2
Many environmental contaminants that serve as activators of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor are known as putative endocrine disrupting compounds.	2
Our results provide strong evidence that LKB1:STRAD:MO25 complexes represent the major upstream kinases acting on AMP-activated protein kinase, although they do not rule out the possibility that the complex might contain additional components.	3
The Western blotting results showed that Orf virus-encoded protein 002 significantly inhibits phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 Ser276 but not NF-κB p65 Ser536 ( ).	1
To further establish role of c-Src in phosphorylation of IQGAP1 we show that in SYF knockout cells where Src family kinases (Yes, Fyn and Src) are absent, IQGAP1 is not tyrosine phosphorylated in response to activation of VEGFR-2, where re-introduction of c-Src rescued phosphorylation of IQGAP1 by VEGFR-2 ( ).	1
It was found that PMA also increased MMP-9 gene expression while the presence of resveratrol inhibited this increase suggesting transcriptional regulation of the MMP-9 gene ( ).	2
We present extensive in vitro work to show that p110β is the only type I phosphoinositide 3-kinase isoform not regulated by RAS and to identify the RHO family GTPases RAC and CDC42 as direct isoform-specific RAS-binding domain interactors and activators of p110β.	1
Previously, it was found that overexpression of oncogenic H-Ras as the last step in the sequential transformation of primary human mammary epithelial cells or in immortalized MCF10A cells resulted in an epithelial to mesenchymal transition concomitant with the downregulation of CD24 surface expression (Morel et al., ).	1
These data revealed down-regulation of several prominent cancer-linked genes that included MMP-1, MMP-9, MMP-14, p21WAF1/CIP1, hTERT, PPARg1, Prox-1 and VEGF (data not shown), and surprisingly, it showed downregulation of Ras mRNA expression.	1
Additionally, we demonstrate that ASPP1 and ASPP2 cooperate with oncogenic RAS to enhance the transcription and apoptotic function of p53 in cancer cells.	1
Thirdly, we report that Ser491//S491 (the site equivalent to Ser487//S487 in AMPK-α2) is an extremely poor substrate for Akt, and that the very low level of α2 phosphorylation obtained using Akt is not affected by an S491A mutation ( D).	1
We observed that endogenous ASPP2 translocates from cell/cell junctions to the cytosol/nucleus following RAS activation ( ).	1
Arany et al. [ ] showed that ERK, and not p38 or JNK/SAPK inhibition, prevented cisplatin induced toxicity.	1
Additionally, our data shows that in fibroblasts treated with TGF-β, Erk is the primary kinase responsible for smad-linker phosphorylation rather than CDK8 and 9 as shown in HaCat epithelial cells , since U0126 was able to completely abolish detectable smad2-linker phosphorylation.	1
Among the signalling pathways involved, NF-κB signalling was the one that enabled the joint control of both MMP-9 and COX-2 inflammation marker expression. , Recent studies point to Sirt1, the most widely investigated and best known sirtuin, as a key regulator of vascular endothelial homeostasis controlling angiogenesis, vascular tone and endothelial dysfunction.	2
Moreover, demonstrated that, during myoblast differentiation, Akt kinase activity correlated with Ser473 but not Thr308 phosphorylation.	1
The pulldown experiments demonstrated that the T73A/S189A double mutation has a negligible effect on Shp2 SH2 binding to Grb2-associtated binding protein 1 ( , A and B), Grb2-associated binding protein 2 ( , C and D), or protein kinase D1 ( , E and F).	1
We observed that wild-type SYNJ2 largely reversed the inhibitory effect of depleting endogenous SYNJ2, whereas the Y490A mutant was much less effective ( ).	1
Although this mutation is only found from one human cancer sample thus far, we were able to go further to show that F395C lacks the ability to promote p53 Thr55 dephosphorylation and transcriptional activation of the p21 gene.	1
By using HEK-293 cells expressing recombinant AMPK-α1, we showed not only that the effect of prior IGF-1 treatment to inhibit subsequent AMPK activation by A769662 was dependent on Akt, but also that it was dependent on phosphorylation of Ser487, since the effect was completely abolished in cells expressing a non-phosphorylatable S487A mutant ( ).	1
In cells stably transfected with DNA that expressed wild-type LKB1 (but not a catalytically inactive mutant), however, the ability of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside and phenformin to activate AMP-activated protein kinase, to phosphorylate Thr172 on the AMP-activated protein kinaseα subunit, and to cause phosphorylation of a downstream target (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) was restored (Figure ).	1
Our immunohistochemistry assays indicated that the Akt phosphorylation level is much higher in seminoma tissues than in normal testicular tissues, and Akt overactivation is common in seminomas.	1
This result is consistent with an association between Fyn and Lck that was reported previously ( ).	1
We have also demonstrated that 14-3-3ζ overexpression could activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase in breast cancer cells.	1
In this study we show for the first time that PI3K/mTOR signaling increases following inhibition of PARP in Small cell lung cancer and that this may be driven through a reduction in liver kinase B1 signaling-changes validated by PARP1 knockdown.	2
Determining molecular mechanism of tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and identification of molecules that are relaying its angiogenic signaling may identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention against angiogenesis-associated diseases.	2
In some experiments we did see a slightly higher level of AKT phosphorylation in the resistant cells compared with the parental cells after 6-24 hours of treatment (as in Fig. ), but this was not consistently observed, leading us to conclude that the pathway responses at the level of Akt were similar between parental and resistant cells.	3
The results in confirm that CaMKKα is capable of phosphorylating and activating BRSK1 in cell-free assays.	1
Because the substrate-trapping mutant binds to the protein in an equilibrium mode, the observed enhanced population of complex, compared with that in the presence of wild-type Shp2, suggests that wild-type phosphatase is turning over phosphorylated Grb2.	2
We found that fangchinoline effectively suppressed proliferation and invasion of SGC7901 cell lines, but not MKN45 cell lines by inhibiting the expression of PI3K and its downstream pathway.	1
Our previous study has shown that Gab2 is overexpressed in colorectal cancer tissues, and this overexpression is significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis [ ].	1
We found that treatment of RasV12 cells with U0126 had a significant 13-fold increase in CD24 mRNA expression (Figures ).	1
The results show that danusertib had a potent inhibitory effect on growth of AGS and NCI-N78 cells.	1
From the results presented so far, we reasoned that Chibby might collaborate with 14-3-3 to relocate β-catenin into the cytoplasm, leading to inhibition of target gene activation.	3
Therefore, we examined mRNA expression of these PDGF signaling molecules by real-time RT-PCR, and confirmed the microarray analysis findings that Pdgf-b, Pdgf-d and Pdgfrb were upregulated by Klf5 deletion (Figure C).	1
Reugg and colleagues, among others, have suggested that transcription factor-mediated transrepression might be the result of competition for a limited pool of co-activator proteins .	3
As shown in (A), The results showed that parental AGS and MKN-45 cells were sensitive to CDDP (1-5 μg/ml), whereas established A549/CDDP cells were relatively resistant to CDDP treatment. (B) showed that both the total and phosphorylated PAK4 levels in AGS/CDDP and MKN-45/CDDP cells were significantly higher than those in their parental cells, respectively.	1
These observations suggest that other residues are important in the regulation of cell motility within the C-terminal portion of p27 and future work will better define the modifications required for proper regulation of cell motility.	2
We found that prolonged expression of active Ras resulted in up-regulation of the MKP3 gene via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway.	1
We show that Dok1 is highly phosphorylated in Crk-transformed cells, and that this phosphorylation is abrogated by the Abl inhibitor imatinib, which stimulates Crk transformation.	1
Our data demonstrated that 14-3-3ζ overexpression leads to phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt activation by binding to the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and increasing phosphoinositide 3-kinase membrane translocation.	1
These conclusions were drawn by the use of several point mutants and by a number of different approaches that demonstrated how the pT198//T198 does not participate neither in the regulation of p27 proteasomal degradation, nor in its ability to bind the Cyclin-CDK complexes and not even in the regulation of cancer cell growth.	1
Blotting with the PP2A C subunit showed that the enhanced interaction between p53 and PP2A seen in the presence of overexpressed B56γ3 was lost in the presence of the QC mutant, suggesting that the QC mutant lost its ability to interact with p53.	2
Recent studies have shown that β-catenin associates with 14-3-3ζ ( ; ).	1
These results strongly suggest that Abi1 mutants, defective in their ability to assemble to phosphoinositide 3-kinase or Eps8, are not only biologically inactive, but act as dominant-negatives, most likely by sequestering the other endogenous components in inactive complexes.	2
We demonstrate that Gab1 is essential for EGF stimulation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and Akt in these cells and that these responses are mediated by complex formation between p85, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, and three canonical tyrosine phosphorylation sites on Gab1.	1
Indeed, it has been shown that multiple serine and threonine residues in the ERK5 C-terminal, including Ser706, Thr732, Ser753 and Ser773, are phosphorylated in a cyclin-dependent kinase 1-dependent manner that does not involve the canonical MEK5-dependent route.	1
These results, together with the findings in , show that the mechanism by which HER2 excludes the interaction of c-Cbl is through suppression of autophosphorylation on the direct and indirect c-Cbl binding sites.	1
In several other E-cadherin-negative cell lines ( B), including A431D (i), CHO (ii), L-cells (iii), SKBr3, and BHK (data not shown), p120 was also diffusely localized, suggesting that in the absence of functional cadherins, p120 cannot associate with cell junctions.	2
PAK4 silencing by RNA interference treatment dramatically reduced the levels of PAK4 in AGS/CDDP tumour tissues. (B) showed that the average tumour volume in the AGS/CDDP group was significantly larger than in the AGS group after 2-week CDDP treatment (P<0.05).	1
In a partial α1β2γ1 complex containing rat α1, which was expressed in bacteria and where Ser485 was therefore most likely unphosphorylated, the ST loop from Glu469 to Val524 was not resolved, indicating that it was mobile within the crystal [ ].	1
This result confirmed that the N-terminus of Orf virus-encoded protein 002 is important for inhibiting nuclear factors κB activation.	1
Furthermore, we observed no significantly increased toxicity or weight loss in the animals that received the combination ( ).	1
The result showed that targeting IQGAP1, c-Src and b-Raf individually by siRNA suppresses the ability of VEGF to stimulate angiogenesis ( ), where control siRNA had no negative effect on angiogenesis ( ).	1
However, a biological stimulus that causes translocation of Net1 from the nucleus to the cytosol has not yet been discovered.	3
We show here that elevated FAM83B expression increases PI3K/AKT signaling, which cooperates to transform human mammary epithelial cells and decreases the sensitivity to of human mammary epithelial cells to PI3K, AKT, and mTOR inhibitors.	1
Various studies showed that certain damage signals, such as loss of cell attachment, will release BCL2-modifying factor, allowing it to translocate, and bind to the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins, BIM, displacing pro-survival BCL2 or BCL-XL, to induce apoptosis. , , Here, we investigated whether the upregulation of BCL2-modifying factor following depletion of endogenous p53-R273H in MDA-MB-468 cells might induce BCL-XL/BCL2-modifying factor hetero-dimerization and disrupt BCL-XL/BIM interaction.	3
We previously showed that expression of CXCR4ΔCTD in MCF-7 cells was associated with constitutive CXCR4 activity, increased motility, and chemotaxis in the absence of CXCL12 in wound closure and chemokinesis assays ( ) and increased metastasis in vivo ( ).	1
These results suggest that modulation of the Tiam1-Rac-Pak signalling pathway could potentially confer resistance to Eg5 inhibitors and highlights that further study of this pathway will be important to inform future clinical studies with this class of drugs.	3
We observed that HRASV12 had the most profound effect on the transcriptional activity of p53 on PIG3 and BAX promoters.	1
Malignant lymphomas occurred at a high frequency (~50%), and the infiltrating lymphoid cells were CD3+CD4+CD8-, indicating a mature helper T-cell phenotype ( ; ), suggesting that NDRG2 is a possible tumour suppressor in various types of cancer, including peripheral T-cell lymphoma.	2
In a previous work, we reported that phosphorylation of SLP-76 was decreased in linker for activation of T cells-/- Bone marrow-derived mast cells after FcɛRI engagement ( ).	1
This result suggests that EGFR and ERK are less crucial than AKT in mediating the effect of KLF5 on hypoxia inducible factor 1α (Additional file : Figure S3).	2
The mRNA level of ASPP2 was not affected upon RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation ( ), indicating that the regulation is not at the transcriptional level.	1
To further support the concept that RARα is critical for TAK165-enhanced differentiation, we tested whether exogenously expressed wild type RARα in HL60R cells could restore the sensitivity of the HL60R cells to the all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation.	3
The list of positives ( ) included two SH3 domain-containing protein that are known to interact with both SYNJ2 and SYNJ1, endophilin and Grb2, and several that previously have been shown to bind to SYNJ1, intersectin, Nck1 and SNX9. , - Remarkably, five members of the Src family of kinases were among the positives, Fyn, Hck, Lck, Lyn and Src.	1
Among a panel of different apoptosis-regulatory proteins, we found only one major alteration, namely an upregulation of Bax that is well detectable 36 h after syncytium formation ( A).	1
However, additional studies using the MKK4-null mouse suggest that the absence of MKK4 does not interfere with induction of apoptosis in response to etoposide, cisplatinum, adriamycin, and gamma irradiation.	2
We calculated P values for each enriched motif and noted that our P value range for these increased motifs were between 8.24E-14 and 5.55E-16, indicating that the increased binding shown in Figure A and B was extremely significant.Figure 3 Transcription factor analysis. (A) Graph of transcription factors enriched in significantly upregulated genes following ETP-45658 treatment.	1
Further work by our group has shown that PARP1/2 inhibitors talazoparib (BMN 673), olaparib (AZD2281), and rucaparib (CO-338, AG 014699) have single-agent activity in preclinical models [ , ].	1
To generate mammalian expression plasmids (pSBP-PRL-3) encoding fusion proteins that could be pulled down using streptavidin-Sepharose (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden), coding sequences for PRL-3 and mutants were cloned into pSBP, a pcDNA3-based vector into which we had previously inserted streptavidin-binding protein .	3
Reprobing for HER2 showed that both the WT-HER2 and the Y1139F-HER2 proteins were unaffected by EGF stimulation.	1
Although induction of cardiac hypertrophy is a multifaceted process, inhibition of Shp2 activity through AKAP-Lbc-anchored PKA is a previously unrecognized mechanism that may promote cardiac hypertrophy in response to chronic β-adrenergic stimulation.	2
Thus, the greater yield of definitive endoderm cells in combination with the reduction in cytotoxicity makes AA-Torin a superior alternative to AA-LY treatment and provides compelling evidence to suggest that the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2-mediated regulation of Smad2/3 linker phosphorylation is a critical mechanism accounting for the inhibitory effect of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase on Activin-induced definitive endoderm differentiation.	2
Altogether these data demonstrated that threonine 198//T198 phosphorylation is an important event that may favor the p27/stathmin interaction eventually influencing ECM-driven cell motility.	1
First we showed that activated EphB1 recruits Grb2 either directly or through the intermediary of the adaptor protein p52Shc.	1
This is supported by the observation that the Rac-specific GEF activity, detected in total cellular lysates and in the immunoprecipitated trimeric Sos-1-E3b1-Eps8 complex, is not apparently affected by receptor tyrosine kinase activation (unpublished data).	2
In summary, the structural analysis suggests that T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule could be involved in recruitment of src homology 2 domain-containing signaling proteins to the plasma membrane after T Cell Receptor-mediated activation of T lymphocytes.	3
Our previous work has shown that exposure to inorganic arsenic in utero produces hepatocellular carcinoma in adult male mice.	1
We further demonstrated that the Gab1-Shp2 complex is responsible for the negative regulation of the strength and duration of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt signaling in response to EGF previously observed in Shp2 -/- cells.	1
Animal data presented in this paper suggests that mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibition may be of use in acute inflammatory renal disorders, and in chronic conditions characterized by fibrosis.	2
We propose that a combination of treatments that both inhibit ATP synthesis and accelerate ATP turnover (phenformin and A23187), as opposed to two different treatments that accelerate ATP turnover (2-deoxyglucose and A23187) may make it more difficult for the cells to maintain their energy status.	2
Moreover, activation of Akt in response to insulin stimulation has been shown to involve the phosphorylation of Ser473 and Thr308 residues ( ). also reported that 4-hr exposures to 50 μM arsenite or 2 μM methylarsonous acid inhibited insulin-dependent phosphorylation of Akt on both Ser473 and Thr308 residues in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.	1
Therefore, it may be the mesenchymal phenotype that predisposes a cell to lose CD24 expression in response to Ras transformation while other cell types will gain or retain CD24 expression dependent on their epithelial vs. mesenchymal status.	2
Given the fact that all three 14-3-3 isoforms bind to Chibby ( and ) and sequester it into the cytoplasmic compartment ( and not depicted), we concluded that overexpression of 14-3-3 proteins is most likely to exert pleiotropic effects on the TopFlash reporter, potentially by interacting with multiple cellular target proteins.	2
Previous studies demonstrated that mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling through the effector extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 was robustly activated in response to CXCR4 signaling in breast cancer cells ( ), which we confirmed in cells grown in a monolayer in 2D culture (Supplemental Figure S3b).	1
Using comparative bioinformatic analysis, we found that CSF-1R modified a set of proteins which did not overlap with those phosphorylated downstream of other Receptor tyrosine kinases e.g., EGFR and ERBB2.	1
We show that ETP-45658 treatment resulted in a rapid and potent reduction of AKT phosphorylation on serine residue 473 and the concomitant reduction of FOXO3a phosphorylation.	1
Furthermore, we demonstrated that there was an interaction between HSP20 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase in the clinical specimens from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.	1
These results strongly suggest that group I p21-activated kinases function downstream of Tiam1 to oppose centrosome separation in early mitosis, and that this function requires their kinase activity.	2
In kinase assays with MED14 proteins immunoprecipitated from HEK293T cells, full-length MED14 was phosphorylated efficiently by ERK but MED14 lacking the SPR (MED14Δ) was not (Supplementary Figure S2b), confirming that ERK phosphorylation was confined to the SPR domain.	1
The bottom three panels in Figure , probed with anti-glutathione-S-transferase, anti-FLAG or anti-Myc antibodies, confirm that the relevant STRAD and MO25 subunit co-precipitated with LKB1 when DNAs encoding these subunits had been co-transfected.	1
To demonstrate further that RAS activation is required to enhance the transcriptional activity of p53 via ASPP1 or ASPP2, a wild-type RAS or a dominant negative form of HRAS-HRASN17 was co-transfected with ASPP2 and p53 into Saos2 cells.	1
Given its reported capacity to interact directly or indirectly with these barrier-regulatory cytoskeletal structures, c-Abl is ideally positioned to participate in multiple pathways that determine vascular endothelial permeability.	1
However, data from other groups suggest that integrins are able to activate at least some of these pathways independently of FAK ( ; ; ).	2
Our previous studies showed that in addition to PARP, Small cell lung cancer cell lines also overexpress liver kinase B1 [ ].	1
Work from several groups has reported that phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase also binds to FAK ( ) and promotes survival of epithelial and endothelial cells in the presence of serum after loss of attachment from matrix ( ; ), the converse condition to that of the experiments described above, in which matrix is provided and serum is withdrawn.	1
If MKK4 is a critical intermediate in the fibronectin-FAK survival pathway, we reasoned that MKK4-null cells, like FAK-null cells ( ), should show abnormally high apoptosis when cultured in the absence of serum.	1
Third, we employed a p53-inducible green fluorescent protein construct that, when transiently transfected into HeLa envelope glycoprotein complex cells, cultured in the absence of HeLa CD4 cells, fails to be expressed, unless it is cotransfected with p53 (but not with a dominant negative p53 mutant, p53H175) ( D).	1
Thus, while both p21-activated kinase and Freud1/Aki1 are dispensable for AKT Ser473 phosphorylation downstream of the EGF receptor, these examples indicate that the use of scaffold proteins may be a common feature in AKT activation by different receptors.	2
These results show that when Sos-1 is engaged in a multimolecular complex containing at least Eps8, E3b1, and Sos-1 itself (the contribution of other proteins cannot be excluded), it displays exclusive Rac specificity.	1
Here through in vitro mutational analysis, we showed that neither serine 136//S136 nor serine 112//S112 of BAD was a significant site of Pak1 phosphorylation.	1
Consistent with the fact that αvβ3 is a major vitronectin receptor ( ), we found that silencing uPAR or β3 integrin only affected Rac activity in BE cells plated on vitronectin and not on collagen or fibronectin, which are major β1 integrin ligands (Fig. S5 E).	1
Recently, some groups have reported that the combination of RAF inhibitors and MEK inhibitors shows significant synergistic anti-tumor effects in melanoma with v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) V600E mutation [ , ].	1

Using an affinity precipitation method to pulldown the active form of Rho GEFs from different cellular fractions, we show here that nuclear Net1 does in fact exist in an active form, contrary to previous expectations.	1
It is possible that the effects of HSP20 on AKT might differ between normal cardiomyocytes or mesenchymal stem cells and hepatocellular carcinoma cells.	3
"However, the alterations made the EGFR protein always active, regardless of a stimulating signal, and caused them to ""grow out of control."" They then treated the cells expressing the various alterations with different EGFR inhibitor drugs and showed that the specific alteration determined whether cell growth could be stopped by a specific drug."	3
It has been reported that RhoA activation regulates ERK activity, although the data are controversial with regard to the net effects of this regulation [ , ].	1
These findings validate our observations in breast cancer cells ( , ), and confirm that P-REX1 levels are inversely correlated with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity.	1
Although CXCR7 ligands CXCL11/ITAQ and CXCL12 (SDF-1α) were not detected, these results do not rule out the possibility that CXCR7 heterodimerized with CXCR4 to modulate its activity ( ; ; ).	3
Using subcellular fractionation methods that do not require detergents, we have found that at least 90% of p120 in this simplified system cofractionates with E-cadherin.	1
We found that a Raf-1 inhibitor reduced phosphorylation of BAD at serine 112 in 293T cells under a condition where it actually slightly increased phosphorylation of Erk1 ( , lane 4).	1
Kinase assay was carried out as in , except that substrates were the indicated GST-BAD mutants (aa 104-141).	1
Reduced Akt activation was also associated with inhibition of C2C12 myoblast differentiation ( ). reported that dwarfism, impaired skin development, skeletal muscle atrophy, delayed bone development, and impeded adipogenesis occurred in mice lacking Akt1 and Akt2.	1
Western blot analysis showed that exposure of SGC7901 to fangchinoline (10/20/30 μmol/l) for 48 h dramatically decreased levels of MMP2, MMP9, phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Aktp-Ser308 but had little effect on Akt ( ).	1
To examine whether expression of recombinant LKB1 might restore the ability of HeLa cells to respond to these drugs, we used the HeLa cell line that stably expresses wild-type LKB1 [ ].	3
This finding was confirmed in a cellular context by showing that knocking down the Grb2 concentration in three different cell lines results in lower constitutive FGFR2 phosphorylation.	1
In this study we were able to show for the first time that HRAS mutant cancer cell lines can be targeted by MEK kinase inhibition (Figure ).	2
Furthermore, suggested that Akt-activated mTOR signaling and its downstream targets p70s6k and PHAS-1/4E-BP1 are the crucial regulators of skeletal muscle hypertrophy and that Akt/mTOR activation can prevent skeletal muscle atrophy induced by disuse.	2
A somewhat unexpected finding shown in was that, although treatment with 3 μM A23187 alone did not significantly increase the ADP/ATP ratio, when combined with 10 mM phenformin it caused a much larger increase in this ratio than that caused by phenformin alone.	1
These results show that, under appropriate conditions, phenformin can activate AMPK even in cells lacking LKB1. (A) HeLa cells were treated with increasing concentrations of A23187 in the presence and absence of 10 mM phenformin.	2
It has been reported that in PANC-1 cells, EGF treatment induces RhoA translocation from the cytosol to the membrane fraction, and actin stress fiber assembly [ ].	1
These results suggested that HER2-mediated MEK/ERK regulates the expression of COX-2, which subsequently suppresses the AKT signaling pathway in non-small-cell lung cancer cells.	2
It is possible that these proteins affect hypoxia-inducible factor-1α expression in hypoxic breast cancer cells.	3
Although the expression of other putative Rac exchange factors like Sos1, PIX, Vav2, and Stef was not affected, we cannot exclude that the expression of as yet unidentified Rac exchange factors is influenced by oncogenic Ras signaling.	2
These results indicated that RhoA phosphorylation by ERK enhanced its function in regulating the formation of stress fibers, possible through increasing RhoA activity. (A) Images of actin stress fibers.	1
We showed that BIAcore measurements revealed similar kinetic parameters for the SH3-mediated Sos-1-Grb2 and S/E interactions ( D).	1
These data indicate that T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule could represent a protein that is preferentially phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases of the src family.	3
These findings led us to hypothesize that p53-R273H might exert its gain-of-function effects through activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and/or inhibition of histone deacetylase activities.	3
Given that SHP2 has been shown by several groups to regulate EGFR activity ( ; ), it is not surprising that we also found SHP2 to be a significant marker of the classical subgroup of Glioblastoma multiforme.	1
Given that the sequences around the threonine residue in the activation loop are highly conserved between AMPK and the ARKs, it remains unclear why the latter should be phosphorylated and activated by LKB1 complexes, but not by CaMKK-α or -β.	3
Previous studies showed that Orf virus-encoded protein 002 inhibits the activation of nuclear factors κB, the master transcriptional regulator of immune response during orf virus infection .	1
Several reports showing p120 absence, downregulation, or mislocalization in human tumors imply that dysregulation of p120 could contribute to the malignant phenotype ( ; ; ; ; ; ).	3
In addition to stimulating CARP-1 expression, activation of pro-apoptotic stress-activated protein kinases (p38 and JNK), and various caspases, our current studies demonstrate for the first time that Medulloblastoma cell growth inhibitory signaling activated by CARP-1 functional mimetics involved up-regulation of NTF3 and biphasic regulation of NF-κB signaling, while key transducers of invasion and metastasis pathways were down-regulated.	1
Together, these data suggest that (a) assembly of FAK-containing molecular complexes at focal adhesion sites is required for survival of anchorage-dependent, serum-deprived cells, and that (b) a region of FAK (and FRNK) NH2-terminal to focal adhesion targeting contains a site important for transduction of survival signals.	2
Our results suggest that A383G also specifically lost its ability to interact with p53 ( ).	2
To confirm that the band shifts were due to phosphorylation, we analyzed the electrophoretic mobility of p120 before and after treatment with λ phosphatase, which acts on phosphorylated serine, threonine, and tyrosine.	1
Indeed, overexpression of activated MEK1S218D,S222D (MEK-DD) rescued the effects of SMYD3 depletion in lung cancer cells ( ) Since the intrinsic kinase activity of MAP3K2 is not directly altered by methylation we postulated that this modification event was involved in modulating a key protein-protein interaction.	2
We recently showed that LKB1 exists as a complex with two accessory subunits, STRADα/β and MO25α/β.	1
These results demonstrate that the Shank3 protein forms a specific complex with the Ret9 isoform through a novel Ret9 PDZ-binding motif.	1
These results provide compelling evidence that therapeutically targeting FAM83B may inhibit both MAPK and AKT signaling simultaneously in tumors dependent on EGFR/RAS signaling.	2
We demonstrated that Chibby physically interacts with β-catenin in a manner that competes with Tcf/Lef factors, and thus represses β-catenin-mediated gene activation.	1
The data strongly suggest that cadherins are the only cellular proteins capable of recruiting p120 to membranes.	2
Accumulating evidence has indicated that Rac1 can be activated by various stress stimuli such as hypoxia .	2

Our results demonstrated that the Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk signaling cascade is negatively regulated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Aktdependent transcriptional activation of the MKP3 gene. [BMB Reports 2014; 47(12): 685-690]	1
In addition, our findings show that danusertib significantly suppressed epithelial to mesenchymal transition in AGS and NCI-N78 cells.	1
S2 shows that the Abi1 peptide encompassing the p85 interaction site phosphorylated on tyrosine 407, but not the one in which Y407 was replaced by F, efficiently competed the p85-Abi1 interaction.	1
These results confirmed that both RhoA 88S and 100T are phosphorylated in response to EGF. (A) EGF-induced serine and threonine phosphorylation of RhoA and mutants.	1
Coexpression of dominant-negative Ras with green fluorescent protein+FAK did not trigger elevated apoptosis if serum was present, indicating that dominant-negative Ras was not acting as a broad-spectrum signaling inhibitor.	1
Specifically we report that mutation of tyrosine 600//Y600 and 778 to phenylalanine impairs EphB1's interaction with c-Src and the p52Shc phosphotyrosine binding domain and thereby the subsequent ERK activation necessary for chemotaxis.	1
adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma cells do not harbour genetic alterations in PTEN and PI3KCA but express high levels of PTEN that is highly phosphorylated at its C-terminal tail.	1
Taken together, these results demonstrate that E-cadherin acts as a crucial suppressor of ovarian cancer invasiveness, and along with other described mechanisms, the loss of E-cadherin plays an important role in FGF2-induced cell invasion.	1
The G-rich sequences that are capable of forming G-quadruplexes are not rigid and can somewhat vary.	2
Together, these studies demonstrate that Pak1 phosphorylates BAD directly on serine 111 in vivo and indirectly on serine 112 through Raf-1. (A) 293T cells were co-transfected with expression vectors encoding full length BAD (wild-type, serine 111A, or serine 112A) and Pak1 (kinase dead Pak1 or T423E).	1
To confirm that the inhibition of activation loop phosphorylation was specific to AMPK, we showed that neither the phospho- nor the dephospho-peptide inhibited activation and phosphorylation of the AMPK-related kinase BRSK2 by LKB1 ( C).	1
To identify the serine residues that could be phosphorylated by Pak1, we constructed additional mutations in the serine 112/136A protein, and then purified and tested these GST fusion proteins in kinase assays ( ).	3
In order to explore the potential of mitogen-activated protein kinases as a novel intervention strategy in kidney disease, it is important to establish the renal conditions that can specifically benefit from mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibition, since studies have shown that not all conditions can be improved through inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling cascade [ ].	2
As such, our finding of a significant correlation between SRC activity and FRK tyrosine phosphorylation in human lung tumors raises the possibility that SRC-mediated phosphorylation of FRK may negatively regulate FRK functions.	2
Notably, we also found that the SO4 cell line, which has a higher level of PTEN expression, contains high levels of phosphorylated PTEN and an elevated level of phosphorylated AKT ( ).	1
Taken together, these results provide evidence that PP2A-mediated activation of p53 may play an important role in prevention of tumor progression.	2
Figure shows that LKB1 alone did not significantly increase the activity, or phosphorylation of Thr172, of the AMP-activated protein kinaseα1 catalytic domain above the basal activity observed in the presence of glutathione-S-transferase alone (compare lanes 1 and 14).	1
In our previous study, we showed that cancer cell lines with Ras or Raf mutations were enriched in the category of cells most responsive or sensitive to AMG655.	1
Previous studies have shown that 14-3-3ζ mildly enhances β-catenin-dependent activation of TopFlash ( ; ).	1
These interactions are not observed in the current p110α crystal structures, suggesting that in solution, p110α could also have a helix kα12, similar to p110γ, p110β and Vps34.	3
These findings suggest that P-REX1 GEF activity and membrane localization are critical for P-REX1-mediated promotion of cell viability.	2
One way to reconcile the apparent importance of Ras in Crk transformation with the lack of obvious elevation in total Ras activity in Crk-transformed cells is to suppose that Ras activation by CrkI is highly localized and therefore not apparent in whole cell lysates.	2
The difference between our data and Kretzchmar et al. could be that our study defined fibroblast TGF-β signaling under endogenous conditions, while Kretzchmar et al. used epithelial cells and defined the interactions of overexpressed Ras and EGF pre-treatment with TGF-β signaling.	3
In particular, other groups have shown that NRAS or KRAS mutations confer resistance to conventional or molecularly-targeted therapies in various malignancies, including myeloma [ , - ].	1
Cells with PIK3CA mutations (n = 3, indicated in green in ) were associated with lower IC50 values, indicating, as would be expected, that cells that are more dependent on PI3K/mTOR signaling for survival are more sensitive to a PI3K inhibitor.	2
However, Chibby does not form a complex with adenomatous polyposis coli or Axin (unpublished data), which implies that the Chibby-14-3-3 route operates independently of that of adenomatous polyposis coli and Axin.	2
The C subunit that was initially bound to B56γ1 was not detected in precipitates between 1 to 5 min after treatment but was detected at subsequent time points and its levels were maintained at an approximately similar level between 15 min and 60 min of stimulation.	1
For human embryonic kidney 293T cells, data are shown as fold stimulation of Rac activation, obtained by dividing the Rac activation in uPAR-transfected cells by that of the vector control for each condition.	1
Given that Bam32 may negatively regulate nuclear factor of activated T cells activation in B cells, it will be important to determine whether defects in Bam32 expression could contribute to increased B cell proliferation and potentially malignant transformation in Hodgkin's lymphoma.	2
This indicates both that dominant-negative Ras is not acting as a general signaling inhibitor, and that the serum survival pathway and fibronectin survival pathway are distinct.	1
In addition, the occurrence of this event in less than 2 minutes of EGF stimulation strengthens the notion that HER2 does not act through tyrosine phosphatases to modulate autophosphorylation patterns.	1
A further layer of evidence came from fluorescent-tagged EGF stimulation studies which demonstrated that Y1068-EGFR is efficiently internalized upon EGF stimulation, but not degraded.	1
Our immunoblotting assays demonstrated that the active mutant of Rac1 Q61L markedly increased the protein levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α under normoxia ( ).	1
For unknown reasons, we were unable to obtain stable 764AAA transfectants in MDA-MB-231 cells. shows that p120 coimmunoprecipitated efficiently with E-cadherin from cells expressing wild-type E-cadherin (lane 5), but not at all from cells lacking E-cadherin (lane 2), or cells expressing 761AAA E-cadherin (lane 8).	1
None of them appears to be interacting with the regulatory β or γ subunits of the AMPK complex [ ] and, consistent with this, those that are expressed in skeletal muscle (SIK2, SIK3, MARK2/3 and MARK4) are not phosphorylated or activated when AMPK is activated in muscle by contraction, AICAR or phenformin [ ].	2
Cells that stain positive for Annexin V:V:phycoerythrin and negative for 7-amino-actinomycin D are undergoing apoptosis, cells that stain positive for both Annexin V:V:phycoerythrin and 7-amino-actinomycin D are either in the final stage of apoptosis, are undergoing necrosis, or are already dead, and cells that stain negative for both Annexin V:V:phycoerythrin and 7-amino-actinomycin D are alive and not undergoing measurable apoptosis.	1
However, previous results showing that Dok proteins can negatively regulate signaling from the B-cell receptor and T-cell receptor, and that they exhibit tumor suppressor activity, suggest a more general role in feedback regulation of the Ras pathway.	2
These results provide concrete evidence that the level of protein expression mirrors the transcriptional response in both cell lines and that physiological consequences must ensue with loss of ARNT.	1
In contrast, no such upregulation of BCL2-modifying factor was observed in cells transfected with p53-R273H mutant, suggesting that p53-R273H, but not p53-R175H, suppresses BCL2-modifying factor expression in MCF-10A cells growing in suspension.	2
Since autodephosphorylation has been proposed as a mechanism regulating PTEN conformation and activity that may be important in some settings ( ), this seems potentially significant.	2
We previously found that PARP is overexpressed in Small cell lung cancer and that targeting PARP reduces cell line and tumor growth in preclinical models.	1
We showed that 14-3-3ζ binding to phospho-serine 83 on the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase increased phosphoinositide 3-kinase membrane localization in cancer cells.	1
Similar results were obtained in A431D cells, where both the 761AAA and 764AAA E-cadherins failed to coprecipitate p120 (data not shown). β-Catenin coprecipitated with both wild-type and mutant E-cadherins (see ), suggesting that conformations adopted by the mutant proteins do not significantly disturb other binding interactions of the cytoplasmic domain.	2
To rule out the possibility that GEFs other than Sos-1 might be contained in the Eps8-Abi1-Sos-1 complex and be responsible for the observed Rac-GEF activity, we engineered a dominant-negative form of Sos-1, carrying point mutations inactivating the Dbl homology domain ( ; ).	3
It is possible that this reflects different roles of these two JNK isoforms in promoting apoptosis vs. protecting cells from apoptosis.	3
These results suggest that phosphorylation of Thr732//T732 is important for ERK5 subcellular localization. (A) HEK293 cells were transfected with empty vector, mycERK5 wild-type (wild type), mycER-32A or mycER-32E.	2
In addition, it is well known that p130Cas and Crk can interact with other partners besides DOCK180.	2
The present results also show that, in mot-2-normal cells with a blocked nuclear factor-kappa B signal pathway, 1.0 μM arsenite increased CBP binding to p53 instead of binding to nuclear factor-kappa B; the change, however, was not evident in mot-2-knockdown cells.	1
These results suggest that PREX1 alterations may be enriched in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway-driven tumors to enhance phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway robustness, and/or vice versa.	2
The control by Grb2 of FGFR2 and Shp2 activity is quite different to that reported for FGFR1, where Grb2 and Shp2 are downstream of FGFR substrate 2 (FRS2) and their recruitment only occurs after receptor activation and is dependent on FRS2 phosphorylation ( ; ).	1
This suggests that Rac1 binds directly to HACE1 once it is activated.	2
Our results show that p85α N-terminal SH2 domain, a key regulatory element for p110α lipid kinase activity, controls access of the catalytic subunit lipid binding sites to membrane.	1
Therefore, it is possible that ASPP1 and ASPP2 may interact with RAS and regulate RAS signalling.	2
Rho activation was not dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase activity ( a), indicating that HGF/cMet receptor stimulation activates Rac and Rho through independent signaling pathways.	1
We showed the concomitant loss of Forkhead box O phosphorylation, nuclear Forkhead box O accumulation, the induction of Forkhead box O-regulated genes, the absence of an arrest phenotype when FOXO3a was knocked down and have also confirmed that this cell cycle arrest response was independent of p53.	1
Our results suggested that BMP9 suppressed the proliferation and metastasis of SK-BR-3 cells in vitro.	2
This observation is in accord with previous studies demonstrating that the C-terminus of p27 is involved in the control of migration but not of cell cycle progression - .	1
In contrast, wild-type E-cadherin induced tightly compacted cell aggregates that could not be dissociated by vigorous pipetting (iii) as was true for the original parental A431 cell line, which expresses E-cadherin (i).	3
Collectively, these observations demonstrate that endogenous PRL-3 can be phosphorylated on tyrosines in vivo, and that phosphorylation likely occurs almost exclusively on Y53 and to a far smaller extent on Y126.	1
Considering the well-documented role for SHP2 in the regulation of EGFR phosphorylation, it is not too surprising that the classical subgroup of glioblastoma, as defined by The Cancer Genome Atlas, was also the group found to have deregulation of EGFR signalling.	1
Interestingly, it appears that the difference in survival signaling between fibronectin and collagen I that is relevant to their differential ability to support survival of rabbit synovial fibroblasts might not be at the level of Ras activation (since ERKs are activated similarly by both matrices), but rather at the coupling of Ras with the JNK pathway.	3
Furthermore, HER2 was undetectable in c-Cbl immunoprecipitates, confirming that c-Cbl does not interact with EGFR-HER2 heterodimers.	1
Band density measurements ( ) confirmed that ERK1/2 and Akt activation in both cells were comparable at the 10 minutes time point, but rapidly declined in the controls to approximately 20% of the initial value, and never fell below 50% of the initial value in the HER2 cells.	2
Additional constructs that mutated serine 111//S111 alone or in combination with serine 112//S112/136A confirmed that only mutation in serine 111//S111 significantly affected Pak1 phosphorylation of BAD ( ).	1
Upregulation of Rho activity alone by expression of activated RhoV14 in MDCK cells is not sufficient to induce transition to a mesenchymal phenotype (data not shown), indicating that the downregulation of Rac represents a crucial step in Ras-induced morphological cell transformation.	1
Collectively, these findings suggest that p53-R273H can specifically drive AKT signaling and suppress BCL2-modifying factor expression, resulting in enhanced cell survivability and anoikis resistance.	2
Because uPAR-driven Rac activation has been shown to promote invasion ( ), BE and MDA-MB-231 cells were assayed for invasion of a three-dimensional collagen matrix in response to a chemotactic gradient of serum. shows that in both cell lines silencing DOCK180 or uPAR inhibited invasion to a comparable degree (40-50%).	1
This is a remarkable result given the large heterogeneity of patients, the different number of patients carrying a specific somatic mutation and the fact that combinations of somatic mutations may induce in a specific patient rather complex and non-linear changes of gene expression.	2
After 18 h, these inhibitors had not promoted elevated apoptosis in rabbit synovial fibroblasts under any of these conditions ( A), indicating that the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase pathway is not required for transducing survival signals downstream of fibronectin.	1
We provide evidence that a fraction of KRas relocalized to endomembranes remains in a signaling competent form, suggesting that this activity-dependent translocation process may spatially segregate and modulate KRas and HRas signaling activities in neurons.	2
It seems therefore that multiple mechanisms could lead to Rac activation from stimulated receptor tyrosine kinase ( ).	3
Both studies indicated that phosphorylation of a component of AP-1 at Ser63 and Ser64 occurred in response to either Ras activation or UV irradiation such phosphorylation, especially at Ser73, enhances the ability of c-Jun to activate gene transcription [ ].	1
Furthermore, these data showed that pS112//S112 reduces phosphorylation of serine 111//S111 by Raf-1 or Pak1.	1
In addition, we previously demonstrated that the phosphorylation of mTOR effectors S6K and 4E-BP1 was increased in cells harboring elevated FAM83B expression.	1
At this stage, we cannot formally exclude that an unknown GEF, coprecipitating with Sos-1, is responsible for the observed activity.	3
Similar in vitro binding assays were performed using recombinant proteins to determine the effects of phosphorylation of nmMLCK by c-Abl on nmMLCK-cortactin interaction. demonstrates that c-Abl phosphorylation of nmMLCK serves to significantly increase its interaction with recombinant cortactin protein to a greater extent than induced by pp60src-phosphorylated nmMLCK.	1
Consistent with our results, it has been found that the phosphorylation of serine 188//S188 on RhoA by PKA induced by nerve growth factor blocks RhoA association with ROCK1 without affecting its ability to interact with other effectors including rhotekin, mDia, and PKN [ ].	1
This identification of a PTEN-related phosphatase lacking protein phosphatase activity, suggests that protein phosphatase activity may have been selected for during evolution.	2
This observation was obtained either by differential extraction of nuclear and cytosolic proteins ( ) and by video time lapse microscopy demonstrating that the frequency of nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling following cell adhesion to ECM was similar for cells expressing p27threonine 198V or p27threonine 198E (data not show).	1
These findings suggest that HSP20 does not affect the synthesis or stability of phosphoinositide 3-kinase in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. (A) The protein levels of phosphoinositide 3-kinase p85 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase p110α subunits in empty vector transected (lane 1) and heat shock protein20-overexpressing (lane 2) HuH7 cells were determined by a Western blot analysis using phosphoinositide 3-kinase p85 antibodies and phosphoinositide 3-kinase p110α antibodies. (B) The expressions of phosphoinositide 3-kinase p85 mRNA and Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR.	2
Another group reported that the combination of ganetespib with MEK inhibitors shows significant synergistic anti-tumor effects against NSCLCs with rat sarcoma mutations in vitro and in vivo [ ].	1
Taking these observations into consideration, our data suggest that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway transmits the active Ras signal to MKP3 expression, which in turn leads to the down-regulation of the Erk1/2 activity in NIH3T3 cells.	2
A previous study by Dufour et al. reported that suspension culture of Caco-2/15 epithelial cells in serum-free medium for 24 h caused reduced levels of phospho-Ser473//S473 on AKT1 and AKT2, and β1 integrin-blocking antibodies could also reduce AKT1 phospho-Ser473.	3
We observed that EGF treatment of mouse embryonic fibroblasts resulted in rapid Tyr-phosphorylation of Ack1 as well as Akt1 at 5 and 10 mins respectively, suggesting that these two Tyr-phosphorylation events could be linked ( ).	3
Furthermore, we confirmed that TAS-116 triggered a decrease in mitochondria transmembrane potential in a time-dependent manner ( ).	1
Since HeLa and MCF7 cells express different LPA receptors , , our results suggest that distinct members of this G protein-coupled receptor family use different mechanisms for AKT activation. (A) HeLa cells were transfected with RICTOR-directed siRNA or non-target siRNA and then stimulated with LPA (10 µM) for 20 minutes.	2
Therefore the data together indicate that PAK4 and PI3K/Akt pathway reciprocally activate each other in CDDP-resistant gastric cancer cells. (A and B) The effects of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (LY) on both phosphorylated and total Akt expression levels were determined by Western blotting at the indicated time points in AGS/CDDP and MKN-45/CDDP cells, respectively. (C and D) The effects of the LY on both phosphorylated and total PAK4 expression levels at the indicated time points in AGS/CDDP and MKN-45/CDDP cells, respectively.	1
While we were working on the purification of the kinase in fraction B, it was reported that serine 83//S83 on p85 can be phosphorylated by the 40 kDa protein kinase A (PKA) within the size range of fraction B ( ).	2
This is a strong indication that p160ROCK inhibition causes changes in centrosome structure, namely in the intercentriolar linker, which seems to be an important determinant of the intercentriolar distance in G0-G1 cells ( ).	1
Comparison of the peptide sequence deduced from the cDNA and the actual mass spectrum of the peptide suggested that two amino acid residues in the internal peptide were likely miscalled because of the very low intensity of the ions of the relevant peptide fragments (see Fig. ).	2
Western blot analysis showed that TAS-116 markedly inhibited p-C-Raf, which was paradoxically activated by dabrafenib in U266 myeloma cells ( ).	1
Src homology domain-containing phosphatase 2 is well known to enhance the half-life of active RAS and as such it is possible that the knockdown of SHP2 activity and its consequent effects on RAS activity are responsible for the senescence that we observe in Glioblastoma multiforme cell lines.	2
We found that cells expressing Ret9, but not Ret51, respond to ligand stimulation and form tubules ( , a, b, d, and e).	1
Furthermore, we showed that RASV12 caused phosphorylation of ERK1/2 at its TEY site, but not at the ERK5 TEY site in HEK293 cells.	1
The result showed that over-expression of c-Src or dominant negative c-Src in PAE cells do not alter the ability of VEGFR-2 to stimulate tube formation ( ), indicating that perhaps c-Src activity is not required for VEGFR-2 to stimulate tube formation of endothelial cells.	1
Our results showed that BMP9 suppressed the proliferation and metastasis of SK-BR-3 cells in vitro and inhibited the tumor growth in vivo through inactivating MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways.	1
The restricted expression pattern of Bam32, together with its upregulation during B cell activation, strongly suggests that Bam32 functions as a specific regulator of B cell signaling pathways.	2
We found that HRAS mutations at position G12 or Q61 rendered transformed Ba/F3 equally sensitive to MEK inhibitors indicating that all activing mutations at position G12 and Q61 might be eligible for targeted treatment patients with HRAS mutant tumors (Figure , ).	3
Previous reports have shown that in addition to liver kinase B1, AMPKα activity can be modulated by the loss of liver kinase B1's binding partners MO25 and STRAD (that liver kinase B1 must complex with to activate AMPKα), and also the loss of the promotion of phosphorylation by ATP/ADP, inhibition of dephosporylation and promotion of the allosteric activation of phosphorylated AMPKα [ ].	2
It is proposed that Rac in turn can stimulate Pak1 via cdc42, which could induce phosphorylation of myosin light chain, thus linking this Ras/Rac-induced pathway to proteins directly affecting cell movement [ , ].	3
Fourth, the AMP-activated protein kinase kinase activity in AMP-activated protein kinase kinase1 and AMP-activated protein kinase kinase2 was not a contaminant that co-precipitated with anti-LKB1 antibody, because recombinant complexes of glutathione-S-transferase-LKB1, STRAD and MO25 expressed in 293 cells and purified on glutathione-Sepharose also activated the AMP-activated protein kinaseα1 catalytic domain efficiently, and phosphorylated Thr172 (Figure ).	1
Furthermore, we examined whether fangchinoline inhibited the phosphoinositide 3-kinase in SGC7901 cells, and found that Fangchinoline at 20 μmol/l markedly inhibited the level of phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( ).	1
We identified five siRNAs from two independent commercial sources that were reported by the vendor to be pre-optimised in their specificity of SHP2 silencing.	1
Recently, we reported that the abundance of phosphorylated AKT-Ser473 inversely correlated well with NDRG2 protein abundance in the majority of oral squamous cell carcinoma cases , which are known to have very low frequencies of PTEN and PIK3CA mutations .	1
We observed a high level of apoptosis after expression of CasΔSH3 ( B, panel 2), which supports the results in and A and suggests that interaction of FAK with Cas is essential for the transduction of survival signals from a fibronectin matrix.	2
Moreover, we found that in syncytia mTOR/FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein was enriched in the nucleus, as compared with SCs.	1
As shown here, human immunodeficiency virus-1-envelope glycoprotein complex-induced syncytium formation leads to apoptosis via a pathway that involves p53 on serine 15 phosphorylation by mTOR/FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein.	1
Induction of apoptosis by ligation of endogenous TRAIL with its receptors (e.g., TRAIL/death receptor 5) has been recognized as a critical mechanism underlying the body's immune surveillance against tumors and metastases. , We demonstrated in our previous studies that Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling positively regulates death receptor 5 expression through enhanced CHOP and Elk-mediated transcription. , Moreover, we showed that human cancer cell lines with Ras or Raf mutations were enriched in human cancer cell lines most responsive to the death receptor 5 agonistic antibody, AMG655.	1
However, we show here that ionizing radiation specifically activates the nuclear pool of RhoA (not the cytosolic pool), in addition to nuclear Net1 ( ).	1
In both the A431D ( A) and MDA-MB-231 (data not shown) cells expressing p120-uncoupled E-cadherin, the circumferential actin cables failed to insert into peripheral concentrations of E-cadherin, resulting in circumferential actin rings that were confined to individual cells.	1
Data in the present study show that the Y64F mutation did not decrease focal adhesion targeting in HUVEC expressing Rac1-Q61L ( ).	1
Testicular seminoma accounts for 40%-60% of all testicular germ cell tumors, which are the most common solid tumors in males aged 15-35 years. , Although the cure rate of testicular seminoma at stage I (nonmetastasized seminoma) exceeds 95%, there is a poor prognosis once the tumor spreads to adjacent lymph node groups (including those in the neck, mediastinum, and abdomen), lung, liver, and bones. - Epidemiological studies have indicated that cryptorchidism, gonadal dysgenesis, familial testis cancer, and environmental exposure to chemical substances increase the risk of seminoma occurrence; however, the precise molecular pathogenesis of seminoma is unclear. , , In our previous studies, we identified human testis development-related gene 1 (TDRG1), which is expressed exclusively in the testes.	1
Since we observed that inhibition of MEK partially restored CD24 mRNA with no significant effect on protein levels we next determined if inhibition of Raf directly could restore CD24 expression levels.	3
We have previously shown that interference with E3b1 functions, by microinjection of anti-E3b1 antibodies, inhibited PDGF-induced ruffles ( ).	1
This showed that Nedd4L recruitment and ubiquitination of Smad2/3 occurred most effectively only when both T220/T179 and SxS residues were phosphorylated ( ), offering an explanatory mechanism by which Nedd4L selectively targets active Smad2/3 for ubiquitination and turnover.	1
Putting this in a biological context, during embryonic development where TGF-β/Nodal/Activin are at physiological levels, this phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mTOR/Nedd4L-mediated degradation mechanism may act as an internal thermostat that regulates the amplitude of Smad2/3 induction and thereby allowing proper readout of the morphogenic gradient in vivo.	2
Considering that the expression change of hypoxia inducible factor 1α upon KLF5 loss mainly occurred at the protein level but not the mRNA level (Figures , and ) and that post-transcriptional regulation is the major mechanism of hypoxia inducible factor 1α regulation [ ], we focused on the hypothesis that KLF5 loss activates hypoxia inducible factor 1α post-transcriptionally.	1
The data in suggest that, in the absence of functional TrkC, elevated levels of intracellular NTF3 following treatment of Medulloblastoma cells with CARP-1 functional mimetic-4 or CARP-1 functional mimetic-5 contribute to the pleiotropic growth inhibitory effects of CARP-1 functional mimetics.	2
These data suggest that the amino acids on B56γ from 391 to 402 constitute a domain required for interaction with p53.	2
Using this approach, we confirmed that fibronectin is particularly effective in providing survival signals for several cell types, and that these survival signals are transduced by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) ( ; ; ).	1
Similar to these findings, our results revealed that hypoxia elevated not only the level of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase activity but also ERK phosphorylation in breast cancer cells.	1
For example, loss of or mutation in neurofibromin 1 (NF1 that encodes GAP) in neurofibromatosis type 1 (ref. ), mutation in SHP2 (also known as PTPN11 that encodes protein tyrosine phosphatase) in juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia , and the overexpression of growth factor receptors in breast cancer and glioblastoma multiforme have been associated with the hyperactivation of wild-type Ras.	1
These results demonstrate that CXCR4 signaling drives invasion and motility of breast cancer cells, which may lead to heightened metastasis.	1
The role that JNK/SAPK plays in acute kidney injury following cisplatin exposure has been less well characterised; however, it has been shown that JNK/SAPK inhibition resulted in a significant reduction in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in vivo [ ].	1
It is possible that subtle structural arrangements in the EGFR:HER2 heterodimer hinder phosphorylation on the direct and indirect c-Cbl interaction sites, while promoting on those sites that mediate downstream signaling.	3
The elevated level of cleaved PARP in the combination treatment group was notable, suggesting that the apoptotic functions of PARP may continue in the presence of a PARP inhibitor.	2
A capase3/7 activity assay confirmed that exposure to 0.5μM of each of the drugs induced apoptosis in MOS and U2OS, but not in KPD and ZK58 cells (Figure ).	1
The reporter gene containing mutated SAF-binding element, mt SAF-chroramphenicol acetyl transferase, showed no response to oncogenic ras, indicating that Ras-activated SAF-1 that binds to a bona fide SAF-1-binding element can drive chroramphenicol acetyl transferase expression.	2
However, at present the possibility cannot be excluded that ILK may have a scaffold function for AKT activation downstream of a particular stimuli in a certain cell type, but this remains to be demonstrated.	1
Moreover, recently reported that exposure to cadmium during pregnancy reduces birth weight and elevates both maternal and fetal glucocorticoid levels.	1
The regulated phosphopeptide of LMO7 contains the sequence motif R-X-X-[pS]-P, suggesting that an unknown basophilic kinase may be involved in its regulation ( ).	2
These results suggest that Gab2 can enhance colorectal cancer cells metastasis in vivo.Fig. 3Gab2 enhances colorectal cancer cells metastasis in a xenograft model. a Images showing representative hematoxylin and eosin-staining of lungs and livers isolated from mice that received tail vein injection of SW480-NC, SW480-Gab2, SW620-si-Ctrl and SW620-Gab2si cells.	2
However, we found that treatment of RasV12 cells with sorafenib had no effect on CD24 mRNA expression (Figures ).	1
Results indicated that BMP9 down-regulated the HER2 protein expression and inhibited the HER2 phosphorylation at the same time ( ).	1
Our present study showed that EGF stimulated the translocation of RhoA to the plasma membrane and enhanced actin stress fiber formation.	1
Although others have previously shown that RAF inhibitors paradoxically activate ERK signaling in wild-type BRAF and rat sarcoma-mutated tumors [ , - ], we here confirmed that dabrafenib (1.25 to 2.5 μM) activated p-MEK1/2 and p-ERK in both cell lines, suggesting that paradoxical activation also occurs in myeloma ( ). (A) NCI-H929, INA6, myeloma.1S, and RPMI-8226 myeloma cell lines were cultured with tipifarnib (0-20 μM), dabrafenib (0-20 μM), or AZD6244 (0-20 μM) for 72 h. 	2
However, the experiments confirmed that the low levels of p27threonine 198A/G were due to their enhanced protein degradation since their expression could be rescued by the treatment of the cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 ( ).	3
We have also shown that the direct interaction between Rac1 and ERK is mediated through the ERK docking site in the Rac1 C-terminus [ ].	1
The fact that Gab2 expression promotes phenotypes of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in ovarian cancer cells suggests that ovarian tumors with high Gab2 expression may possess higher metastatic potential in patients.	2
This study also showed that ionizing radiation-induced Net1 activity was also responsible for downstream activation of the MAPK pathway, leading to an increase in cell survival .	1
Since P-REX1 activates Rac1/2/3 [ , ], which can promote Pak/Raf/MEK/ERK activation [ - ], and Rac1 was recently found to activate the p110β isoform of Class IA phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [ , ], we postulated that P-REX1 acts through Rac to drive activation of both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT and MEK/ERK signaling in estrogen receptor α+ breast cancer cells.	2
We previously observed that cMyc-overexpressing cell lines tended to be more sensitive than other cell lines to talazoparib (R = -0.262, p = 0.5; ).	2
To confirm that Gab2 induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition to promote colorectal cancer metastasis, we assessed the expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-markers in these cell models.	1
However, these experiments do not exclude the possibility that T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule already associates with components of the TCR-CD3-ζ complex in the cytoplasm.	3
Based on above findings, we speculate that the inhibitory effect of BMP9 may be due to its inhibition on HER2 expression in SK-BR-3 cells.	2
Although we have previously shown that HSP20 inhibits not only the AKT pathway, but also the ERK pathway , we were unable to find any interaction of HSP20 with ERK and MEK.	1
Serum obtained from immunized animals but not the preimmune serum reacts in Western blot with a disulfide-linked 60-kD dimer (30 kD reduced) that is expressed in HPB-ALL cells (Fig. A, left).	1
Although CARP-1 functional mimetic-4 has been demonstrated to activate pro-apoptotic p38stress-activated protein kinases in breast cancer cells , our current studies indicate that in addition to p38stress-activated protein kinases, CARP-1 functional mimetic-4 also activates JNK in Medulloblastoma cells (see and ).	1
Results showed that increased BMP9 expression inhibited the cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration, invasion of SK-BR-3 cells while silencing of BMP9 expression promoted the proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion of SK-BR-3 cells.	1
Together, these results demonstrate that Pyk2 is a newly identified physiological target of activated protein tyrosine kinase(s) after T cell antigen receptor stimulation.	1
In addition, using in vivo intravital imaging, we demonstrate that MCF-7 CXCR4WT cells migrate in single-cell streams toward blood vessels, whereas MCF-7 CXCR4∆CTD cells migrate as single cells toward blood vessels in the mammary gland, which correlates with increased metastasis to lymph nodes and lungs in athymic nude mice.	1
Here we report that genetic inactivation of c-Cbl in mice results in enhanced tumor angiogenesis and retinal neovascularization.	1
Although one mutation in B56ε (PPP2R5E) gene of the B56 family has been reported to associate with increased risk of soft tissue sarcoma ( ), no mutations in the B56α, B56δ and B56γ tumor suppressors have been linked to human cancer to date. p53 is a very important highly studied tumor suppressor protein that functions primarily as a transcription factor ( ; ).	1
Interestingly, PRL-1, which shares all six tyrosines in common with PRL-3, was shown to be phosphorylated by Src in vitro , suggesting that PRL phosphatases may also be regulated by Src family kinases.	2
These data do not exclude that, in addition to the Raf-MAP kinase pathway, other events play a role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, such as changes in phosphorylation of the myosin II light chain or heavy chain ( ; ), which affect cell spreading and cell contraction, or changes in phosphorylation of proteins involved in the formation of E-cadherin adhesions ( ).	2
In the case under study here, down-regulation of Rac1 function by FAK and Src may directly oppose and thereby modulate the largely positive effects that these two nonreceptor tyrosine kinases have on lamellipodial extension by other means, e.g. via βPIX phosphorylation and its subsequent increased activation of Rac1.	2
Specifically we demonstrated that F395C mutant B56γ3 is no longer able to interact with p53 or inhibit cultured cancer cell proliferation or growth on soft agar in a p53-dependent manner.	1
Our present data demonstrate that genetic inactivation of c-Cbl in mice results in an increased in phosphorylation of PLCγ1 leading to endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis.	1
Combined with previous findings, our data suggested that TDRG1 positively regulates the activity of phosphoinositide-3 kinase via the modulation of phosphoinositide-3 kinase/p85 phosphorylation.	2
Figure shows results of an experiment where the amount of AMP-activated protein kinase kinase1 or AMP-activated protein kinase kinase2 was limiting and the antibody was in excess, and shows that we were able to remove more than 80% of the activity from the peak fractions containing AMP-activated protein kinase kinase1 and AMP-activated protein kinase kinase2 by immunoprecipitating with anti-LKB1 antibody, while no activity was removed using a pre-immune control immunoglobulin.	1
Thus, it is possible that HER2 inhibition is not necessary for TAK165 to enhance all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation.	2
Analysis of the overlap between substrates phosphorylated in our study and in human tumors defined a group of proteins that may be most relevant to Src activity in human cancers: HIPK3, STAT5A, p120, Hrs and FRK in human breast tumors, and p130Cas, p120, FRK, Hrs and KIAA0323 in human lung tumors.	2
In summary, the data presented here convincingly demonstrate that CARP-1 functional mimetics activate multiple cell growth inhibitory and apoptosis pathways to suppress Medulloblastoma cell growth, survival and metastasis processes, and underscore their potential as novel class of anti-Medulloblastoma agents.	1
Reconstitution experiments also demonstrated that SMYD3 catalytic activity is required for pancreatic acinar-to-ductal metaplasia ( ).	1
Since we detected a 10-fold increase in CSF-1R-dependent phosphorylation of UQCRC2, this raises that possibility that this modification may downregulate it's activity, thus causing a similar loss of activity as observed in tumor cells with lower levels of UQCRC2 expression.	2
We found that the interaction between the PP2A complex and MAP3K2 is direct, as recombinant PPP2R2A, but not PPP2R1A, bound to MAP3K2-K260me0 peptides and not to MAP3K2-K260me3 peptides in in vitro peptide pull-down experiments ( ; top panel).	1
Our data in show that CARP-1 functional mimetic-4 exposure over a periods of upto 6 hours results in a slight to modest decline in levels of NF-κB inhibitory IκBα and/or IκBβ proteins.	1
Detergent-free subcellular fractionation studies indicated that, in contrast to previous reports, the stoichiometry of the interaction is extremely high.	1
Moreover, it has been reported that tyrosine phosphorylation within the pleckstrin homology domain of protein kinase D1 enhances its catalytic activity ( ).	1
Our preliminary results suggest that Bam32 is expressed in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Marshall, A.J., D. Magaletti, and E.A. Clark, unpublished data), which could potentially account for Bam32 expression in the trachea.	3
Our data demonstrate that Pyk2 is a novel Fyndependent tyrosine-phosphorylated substrate during T cell antigen receptor signaling.	1
All together, these data suggest that Cas binding to Proline-rich region 1 and Cas phosphorylation, most likely by FAK itself, are important for transducing survival signals in cells expressing green fluorescent protein and FAK.	2
Here we characterised the requirement of RICTOR, ILK, and p21-activated kinase for AKT Ser473 phosphorylation downstream of selected family members of integrins, G protein-coupled receptors, and tyrosine-kinase receptors and analysed the importance of this phosphorylation site for adhesion-mediated survival. siRNA-mediated knockdown in HeLa and MCF7 cells showed that RICTOR-mTOR was required for phosphorylation of AKT Ser473, and for efficient phosphorylation of the downstream AKT targets FOXO1 Thr24 and BAD Ser136, in response to β1 integrin-stimulation.	1
These data suggest that uPAR and β3 integrin engage vitronectin to promote Rac activity and tumor cell invasion.	2
We also showed that binding sites for members of the Forkhead box O family of transcription factors were highly enriched in our studies although it remains to be elucidated how phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibition is so efficient at mediating Forkhead box O activation in MCF-7 cells that present a low basal level of AKT activity.	1
A Bam32 src homology 2 domain fusion protein bound in vitro to tyrosine-phosphorylated phospholipase Cγ2 immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane, but not to CD22 ( C), syk, or src homology 2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase (SHIP) (data not shown), suggesting that the Bam32-phospholipase Cγ2 interaction is direct and mediated by the src homology 2 domain.	2
Intriguingly, this was not due to differential Forkhead box O promoter recruitment, suggesting that the disparity between cell cycle arrest and pro-apoptotic Forkhead box O target genes arises after Forkhead box O binding.	2
Finally, we also show that RasGAP knockdown enhances CrkI transformation ( ).	1
Our data show that uPAR expression drives tyrosine phosphorylation of the p130Cas substrate domain, promoting the formation of the p130Cas-Crk complex that recruits DOCK180.	1
Interestingly, this indicates that three independent cell lines showing strong activity of MEK as well as AKT depend on the activity of both pathways.	1
Recent structural and modeling studies on receptor tyrosine kinases suggest that the kinase domains of dimerized receptor molecules form asymmetric dimmer that has a positive allosteric effect on kinase activation ( , ).	2
Finally, in vitro methylation assays on MAP3K2 peptides spanning K260 (aa 249 to 273) with K260 either unmethylated, mono-, di-, or tri-methylated showed that SMYD3 can utilize all lower states of methylation as substrates to generate the fully saturated trimethyl state at K260 ( ).	2
The results presented in demonstrated that the Y1068F-EGFR is more signaling competent than the wild type counterpart, while both the wild type and the mutant HER2 proteins are equally competent.	1

The results of immunohistochemical staining showed that Gab2 was significantly upregulated in primary sites of metastatic colorectal cancer compared with either non-metastatic colorectal cancer or normal tissues (Fig. , ).	1
These data suggest that increased association with GEFs may contribute to increased GTP loading on Rac1-Y64F, and to the increased spreading seen in cells expressing this construct. (A) Protein lysates were harvested from Mouse embryo fibroblast that were co-transfected with Flag-tagged βPIX, and either EGFP-tagged Rac1WT (lane 1) or Rac1-Y64F (lane 2).	2

In a proteomic screen to identify PIP3-regulated proteins as effectors and markers of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation in breast cancer cells, we found that levels of PIP3-dependent Rac exchange factor 1 (P-REX1) were inversely correlated with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation.	1
It has been demonstrated that this null node filters out irrelevant reporters effectively, because irrelevant reporters have a higher attachment likelihood to null than to any other S-gene.	1
Western blotting with anti-phospho-Akt confirmed that Akt is constitutively activated in cells expressing the mutant EGFR ( E).	1

BCL10 is a gene that is known to induce apoptosis and to activate NF-κB .	1
IGF1R inhibition blocks both the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways when RAF and RAS are not mutated, suggesting that combination of p110α and IGF1R inhibitors may be more efficacious.	2
If, as suggested by Anderson et al. [ ], CaMKKβ forms a complex with AMPK α and β subunits in the absence of γ, one might have expected that co-expression of CaMKKβ would have stabilized and increased the expression of GFP-α1 and β1 in the absence of γ1.	3
LKB1 is known to be phosphorylated at up to eight sites, and is also farnesylated at Cys433, near the carboxyl-terminus [ , , , ], suggesting that the difference in mobility might be due to a difference in covalent modification.	3
The similarities between baseline sensitivity to both PARP and PI3K inhibition, where MEK/ERK signaling predicts resistance to both ( and ), suggest that MEK/ERK activation is a potential mechanism of resistance to the combination treatment.	2
We found that treatment with U0126 (MEK1/2) and PD98059 (MEK1) inhibited mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, whereas AMD3100 (CXCR4) had no effect on mitogen-activated protein kinase activation (Supplemental Figure S3c).	1

These results suggest that the phosphorylation of RhoA 88S and 100T increases the interaction between RhoA and ROCK1.	2
Similarly, another study indicated that the level of Gab2 expression was significantly associated with metastatic progression of breast cancer [ ].	1
However, recent studies suggest that these therapies may be limited due to acquired cancer cell resistance and a small therapeutic index between normal and cancer cells.	2
Although we did detect some phosphorylation of Ser491//S491 using a phospho-specific antibody and this was abolished in a S491A mutant, 32P-labelling was not affected by the S491A mutation, suggesting that the low level of α2 phosphorylation by Akt was mainly accounted for by modification at other site(s).	2
Tyrosine phosphorylation of Rac1 has not been explored to date, although we have demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of βPIX is associated with increased binding to Rac1 in vitro, and augmentation of cell spreading .	1
Conversely, the translocation of Bax to mitochondria and of cytochrome c from mitochondria was only found among p53 on serine 15P+ (not p53 on serine 15P-) syncytia ( G), indicating that these changes occur after p53 on serine 15 phosphorylation.	1
Experiments with human and drosophila cell lines, RICTOR-null mouse fibroblasts, as well as in vivo experiments with RICTOR-deficient mice have convincingly shown that TORC2 is a principal physiological PDK2 , , .	1

These results strongly suggest that ERK5 Thr732 is preferentially phosphorylated by ERK1/2, but not by ERK5 itself, when both Extracellular signal-regulated kinase isoforms are physiologically activated by growth factors.	2
Indeed, type-I phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase α (PIP5KI α) has been shown to be essential for invadopodia formation and a number of proteins that have been implicated in invadopodia formation are regulated by PtdIns(4,5)P2, including the actin filament severing protein cofilin and N-WASP, a protein that regulates actin nucleation via Arp2/3. , We also note that both Src and SYNJ2 play critical roles in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. , , Thus, it is likely that Src-stimulated SYNJ2 5'-phosphatase activity also contributes to this function.	1
The results showed that HS1 was highly tyrosine-phosphorylated only when both Lyn and Syk were coexpressed (Fig. ).	1
However, (C) shows that this is not the case: in the presence of β1 the γ1 subunit stabilizes the α1 subunit, but CaMKKβ does not substitute for γ1 in this respect.	1
Through re-expression of phospho-mutant and GEF mutant Tiam1 we showed that activation of Pak1/2 at the centrosomes in prophase is dependent both on phosphorylation of Tiam1 at S1466 ( ) and its ability to activate Rac ( ).	1
We also asked if any known toxicity or stress signalling cascades were triggered after exposure to ETP-45658 and crucially, we note that there was no significant induction of any of the pathways or cascades that we investigated.	3
As expected, cotransfection of Chibby mutants capable of 14-3-3 binding (S18A and S22P) substantially repressed TopFlash activation by β-catenin similar to that observed for CbyWT, with no significant effect on the mutant reporter FopFlash.	1
Therefore, we hypothesized that one or more intermediate signaling molecules in the pathway, such as JNK, might have a role to play in focal contacts as well as in the nucleus.	3
Global ATP concentrations increased following PARP inhibition (p≤0.02) leading us to hypothesize that the observed increased PI3K/mTOR pathway activation following PARP inhibition results from decreased ATP usage and a subsequent decrease in stress response signaling via LKB1.	3
The data also show that when re-expressed in PTEN null glioblastoma cells at a physiological expression level and these cells are grown in Matrigel, both the lipid and protein phosphatase activities of PTEN independently contribute an inhibition of cellular proliferation and that both activities are required in concert to achieve efficient inhibition of invasion.	1
To confirm that the serine 83//S83 site of p85 is phosphorylated in cells in vivo, we raised an antibody against a phospho-peptide corresponding to the 14-3-3 binding motif in p85 surrounding serine 83 (p85-P-serine 83).	1
An important caveat of our studies presented here is that these experiments only present a global snapshot regarding phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-regulated gene transcription six hours after each treatment and does not distinguish between a primary and secondary transcriptional response.	1
Collectively, these results suggest that p53 mutants specifically drive cancer cell survival and anoikis resistance through alteration of AKT signaling.	2
These data suggest that an IGF1R/p110β/AKT/mTOR pathway increases resistance to BYL719.	2
We used two human carcinoma cell lines, the epithelial-like MCF7 and the mesenchymal-like HeLa, which can efficiently be transfected with siRNA. siRNA-mediated knockdown of the main PDK2 candidates, TORC2 and ILK, revealed that TORC2, but not ILK, was necessary for AKT Ser473 phosphorylation downstream of β1 integrins ( ).	2

A time kinetic study showed that MKP3 mRNA was detectable within 3 h after doxycycline addition ( A).	1
Our study also shows that the TAK165 and all-trans retinoic acid combination treatment synergistically induces differentiation by activating the MEK/ERK-mediated RARα/STAT1 axis.	1
In our recent study, we found that Klf5 deletion activates multiple oncogenic signaling pathways including the PI3K/AKT, ERK and EGF/EGFR pathways [ ].	1

Interestingly, direct comparison of the membrane recruitment of the Bam32 versus Btk pleckstrin homology domains indicated that the Bam32 pleckstrin homology domain associates with the plasma membrane of activated B cells with higher stoichiometry than the Btk pleckstrin homology domain ( B).	1
Together these observations support a model in which Src, and possibly members of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor family, acts upstream of PRL-3 to promote invasion, and further suggest that PRL-3 may mediate some of the invasion and metastasis-associated functions of PDGFR, Src or related kinases.	2
Cell migration assays from a confluent monolayer into a 500μm defined cell free gap showed that PTEN retards the rate of migration into this gap.	1

To test the hypothesis that p120 localizes to junctions primarily, if not solely, through its interaction with cadherins, we first examined p120 localization in carcinoma cell lines reported to lack E-cadherin. compares by immunofluorescence the localization of p120 in the relatively normal E-cadherin-positive breast cell line, MCF7, and the E-cadherin-negative cell line, MDA-MB-231 .	2
Indeed, we observed that the ectopic expression of NDRG2 in adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma cells causes suppression of janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription and nuclear factor-kappaB activation (data not shown), although the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are still being elucidated.	1
We hypothesized that loss of c-Cbl might augment tumor growth by increasing angiogenesis.	3
Molecular modelling studies demonstrate that 3',4'-dimethoxy-α-naphthoflavone forms an extra hydrogen bond with aryl hydrocarbon receptor at Thr289 , a characteristic not shared with the partial agonist α-naphthoflavone suggesting that the 3',4'-dimethoxy-α-naphthoflavone-aryl hydrocarbon receptor adopts a unique confirmation.	1
Further, it has been demonstrated that antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family can be negatively regulated by post-translational modification and/or by increased expression of PUMA, an essential regulator of p53-mediated cell apoptosis.	1

We found that Cdk1, cyclin A and cyclin B1 all co-precipitated with Tiam1-GFP from asynchronous and mitotically arrested HEK293T cells ( ), supporting our hypothesis that Tiam1 interacts with active Cdk1 complexes.	1
We have previously shown that E3b1 binds to the proline-rich, COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 (aa 1131-1333) ( ), which also binds to the SH3 of Grb2 ( ; ).	1
These results all demonstrate that the predicted Grb2-binding sites, tyrosines 175, 195, and 235 are, in fact, essential for Grb2 and linker for activation of T cells association.	1
Each of these proteins has been previously implicated in cancer onset or progression, and our data suggest that their tyrosine phosphorylation may play a role in oncogenic changes.	2
Therefore, we hypothesize that in adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma and other types of tumour cells without genetic alterations in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT pathway, the suppression of NDRG2 transcription disrupts the negative regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT signalling via sustained PTEN-Ser380/Thr382/Thr383 phosphorylation during tumour development ( ).	3
Furthermore, no Rac-GEF activity could be detected in Eps8 immunoprecipitates from lysates of cells transfected with Sos-1, E3b1, and an Eps8 mutant that is impaired in its ability to bind E3b1 and thereby cannot form a trimeric complex ( ).	3
Using the LKB1-null G361 cell line treated with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187, we also showed that phosphorylation of Thr172, and activation of AMPK, by CaMKKβ was antagonized by prior phosphorylation of Ser487.	1
To summarize, these data show that combination of mTOR and MEK inhibitors synergistically inhibit downstream signaling and cell growth of HRAS mutant cell lines.	1

Our results also showed that Orf virus-encoded protein 002 interfered with the interaction between NF-κB p65 and MSK1.	1

These results demonstrate that different receptors utilise different enzyme complexes to phosphorylate AKT at Ser473, and that AKT Ser473 phosphorylation significantly contributes to β1 integrin-mediated anchorage-dependent survival of cells.	1
Although not the focus of this study, our analysis also identified an additional 19 novel serine/threonine autophosphorylation sites on nmMLCK that occurred in the absence of other kinases (Suppl. Table).	1
These data indicated that NDRG2 is frequently inactivated by genomic deletion and epigenetic silencing in adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma.	1

Coexpression of dominant-negative Raf1 or dominant-negative MEK1 with green fluorescent protein and FAK resulted in only a small increase in apoptosis compared with control apoptosis levels in cells transfected with green fluorescent protein and FAK ( A), despite the observation that cells expressing dominant-negative Raf1 or dominant-negative MEK1 showed reduced staining with pERK antibodies compared with cells in the same field that did not express these constructs (data not shown).	1
These experiments showed, as might be predicted from previous experiments using mutant proteins ( ), that phosphorylation of bacterially expressed PTEN with CK2 caused a modest reduction in activity against PtdInsP3 and a larger increase in activity against the soluble headgroup Ins(1,3,4,5)P4.	3
Those authors reported that transfection of myristoylated Akt in chicken embryo fibroblasts dramatically enhanced myotube formation and expression of the muscle-specific proteins MyoD, creatine kinase, myosin heavy chain, and desmin.	1

By probing the anti-human HS1 immunoprecipitates with the antiphosphotyrosine antibody, we showed that HS1-FF was not detectably tyrosine-phosphorylated upon B cell antigen receptor crosslinking, whereas wild-type HS1 was highly and rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. C).	1
We have previously shown that Lck plays a major role in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the T cell antigen receptor-ζ chain and the ZAP-70 protein tyrosine kinase.	1

In our previous study , , we reported that the HSP20 expression levels inversely correlate with the TNM stage of human hepatocellular carcinoma, and that the overexpression of HSP20 in human hepatocellular carcinoma-derived HuH7 cells represses cell proliferation.	1
The data suggest that binding of PLX to CRAF induces activation of the enzyme and, subsequently, ERK signaling.	2
This observation is surprising as resistant cells showed complete reduction of AKT phosphorylation upon treatment with BYL719, suggesting that AKT was inactive.	2
The result showed that SU6656 selectively inhibits phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 at Y1173 in a dose-dependent manner but had no effect on the phosphorylation of Y1052 ( ).	1
On the other hand, mutation of the putative Grb2 binding site in HER2 (Y1139) did not affect stability, signaling or transformation, suggesting that Y1139 in HER2 may not serve as a Grb2 binding site.	2
Our results suggest that nuclear RhoA is prenylated in agreement with a previous report showing that nuclear Rac1 is also prenylated .	2
Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that in response to DNA damage, B56γ-PP2A dephosphorylates p53 at Thr55 and promotes its transcriptional activation.	1
This result suggests that RhoGDI1 may restrict the amount of RhoA that can be targeted to the nucleus. (A) HEK293 cells were transfected with non-targeting control or Rho GDI1 siRNA oligonucleotides. 72 hours post-transfection, nuclei were isolated and lysates blotted for RhoA, GDI1, tubulin and Lamin. (B) Quantification of nuclear RhoA levels from three independent experiments is shown in the bar graph, as fold change over control cells.	2
One recent report described an adenocarcinoma of the lung with HRAS Q61L mutation suffering from rapid progression and deterioration suggesting that HRAS mutations in NSCLC tumors might be aggressive and associated with poor overall prognosis, similar to KRAS mutant NSCL [ ].	3
We further showed that MAPK signaling was upregulated in A549 and H322 cells, but not in H1299 cells ( ).	1
The apparent differential regulation of Pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation or activation by Lck and Fyn suggests that Pyk2 may be a preferred substrate for Fyn but not Lck.	2
Interestingly, when aligned with the Btk pleckstrin homology domain, the Bam32 pleckstrin homology domain also contains an amino acid substitution in the β3 strand found in a gain-of-function Btk mutant that shows constitutive membrane association (E41K; references 14, 38).	1
We observed that vanadate was not required to detect phosphorylation of PRL-3 by Src in SW480 cells ( ) whereas it was required in SYF cells ( ).	1
We have previously reported that the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase by AMP-activated protein kinase kinase1 (called at that time AMP-activated protein kinase kinase) was stimulated by AMP, and presented evidence favoring the hypothesis that AMP acted not only by binding to the downstream kinase and making it a better substrate, but also by activating the upstream kinase [ ].	1
It seems likely that other p53 mutants might cooperate via different mechanisms, independent of BCL2-modifying factor, to convey different oncogenic signals to promote aggressiveness in human cancers.	3
In comparison with the marked upregulation and reduction of T220/T179//T179 phosphorylation observed in control cells upon heregulin and IGF-1 and LY treatment, respectively, expression of Akt possessing varying states of activation had negligible impact on T220/T179 phosphorylation ( ), suggesting that Akt is not directly responsible for this phosphorylation.	2
We further demonstrate that a fraction of RhoA resides in the nucleus, and can also be found in a GTP-bound active form and that Net1 plays a role in the activation of nuclear RhoA.	1
Data unveiled that while the association between p27threonine 198E and stathmin was readily detectable ( and ) the threonine 198V mutation strongly impaired this association ( and ).	2
Because it is possible that the differences in Pyk2 phosphorylation observed in lck-/- and fyn-/- thymocytes might reflect heterogeneity in the cellular subsets in these mice, the regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 by Lck and Fyn was further studied in a heterologous cell system, COS-7 cells.	3
Here, we found that a submicromolar concentration of As2O3 significantly and dose-dependently inhibited myogenic differentiation by inhibiting an Akt signaling pathway.	1

Our analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data showed that phosphatase expression alone can be used to recapitulate the subdivision of Glioblastoma multiforme into four subgroups as identified by The Cancer Genome Atlas using the whole genome-derived 840 gene identifier ( ), suggesting that phosphatases play an important role in the underlying biology of Glioblastoma multiforme.	2
Results showed that the proliferation and metastasis of SK-BR-3 cells after adenovirus interfering BMP9 transfection were reversed by PD98059 and LY294002 ( ).	1

Taken together, these results demonstrate that ErbB3 can partially compensate for Gab1 deficiency in EGF-induced activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt signaling pathway, although Gab1-mediated activation appears to be more robust, and likely represents the primary mechanism by which EGF stimulates phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and Akt.	1
Taken together, these results show that danusertib can upregulate expression of p21 Waf1/Cip1, p27 Kip1, and p53, contributing to the inducing effect of danusertib on cell cycle arrest in AGS and NCI-N78 cells.	2
These results suggest that downregulation of rat sarcoma in rat sarcoma-mutated myeloma cells regulates myeloma cell survival, at least in part, via cell cycle modulation.	2

Using cultured human prostate cancer cell lines with deficient or insufficient PTEN, not only did we confirm the activation of AKT by KLF5 loss (Figure A), we also found that activated AKT indeed mediated the upregulation of hypoxia inducible factor 1α by KLF5 loss, since treatment with PI3K inhibitors prevented both the activation of AKT and the accumulation of hypoxia inducible factor 1α (Figure C, D).	1
For example, the involvement of small G proteins such as RAS and RAP1 in ERK5 activation remains controversial [ ], although it is well known that these small G proteins mediate ERK1/2 activation upon ligand binding to receptor tyrosine kinases [ , ].	1
On the one hand, we previously showed that imatinib had little effect on the anchorage-independent growth of cells transformed by Src or Ras ( ), and preliminary experiments with a panel of human cancer cell lines showed that Abl inhibitors do not generally stimulate the growth of tumor cells (KN and BJM, unpublished observations).	1
The first mutation, E69K, has been well studied and is known to have 16-fold higher phosphatase activity than wild-type SHP2 ( ), although a more recent study by the same group determined that the tumourigenic potential of SHP2 mutation does not necessarily correlate with protein tyrosine phosphatase activity ( ).	2
Only a minor difference due to presence of pY2-peptide was observed under our assay condition, which is different from that published previously ( ).	2

Our data showed that like tumor-induced angiogenesis, VEGF-induced angiogenesis was also elevated in c-Cbl knockout mice compared to wild type mice ( ).	1
Here we show that phosphorylation of p53, via a pathway not related to DNA damage, is involved in envelope glycoprotein complex-induced syncytial apoptosis.	1
This outcome might reflect additive effects - directly due to reduced pY1148//Y1148 and indirectly due to reduced pY1068//Y1068 (Grb2-mediated); note that Shc proteins can make direct and indirect (through Grb2) interactions with activated receptors.	3

Shinohara et al. ( ) reported that phosphorylation of tyrosines 259//Y259 and 361 was required for RasGAP binding, while phosphorylation of tyrosines 336 and 340 inhibited Erk activation through unidentified mechanism(s).	1
We show here that Shank3 function is required for sustained activation of both Erk-MAPK and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase pathways downstream of Ret9.	1
As compared to the controls, the HER2 cells showed basal ERK1/2 and Akt activation, suggesting that HER2 alone can induce a low level of constitutive signaling.	2
Because uPAR may signal together with integrins, we examined the role of GEFs that have been linked to integrin signaling to identify GEFs that may function downstream of uPAR.	2
We have previously shown that these compounds, termed CARP-1 Functional Mimetics , suppress growth of a variety of cancer cells in part by stimulating apoptosis .	1
Immunohistochemistry showed that there was a lower expression of HER2, p-HER2, p-ERK1/2 and p-AKT in SK-BR-3/BMP9 group when compared with SK-BR-3 group; while there was a higher expression of HER2, p-HER2, p-ERK1/2 and p-AKT in SK-BR-3/siBMP9 group, when compared with SK-BR-3 group ( ).	1
In previous studies, we showed that Sos-1, E3b1, and Eps8 could form a trimeric complex in vivo upon concomitant overexpression of the three proteins.	3
Our results show that both RhoA and Net1 can be activated by ionizing radiation in isolated nuclei in the absence of any signals from the cytoplasm ( ).	2
These inhibitor experiments as well as our observation that there is a reduction in CD24 cell surface protein expression but not mRNA expression in RasV12G37 cells strongly suggest that the downregulation of CD24 mRNA and surface expression are not mediated by the same mechanisms.	2
This was also observed for the Forkhead box O target genes SOD1 and SOD2 that are known to be involved in resistance to oxidative stress [ ].	1
Nonetheless, the presence of HER2 autophosphorylation on these sites suggests that they may contribute to the direct and indirect binding of other signaling proteins.	2
We also show that when re-expressed at physiological levels in PTEN null U87MG glioblastoma cells the protein phosphatase activity of PTEN is not required to regulate cellular PtdInsP3 levels or the downstream protein kinase Akt/PKB.	1
The other two peptides sequenced (see Materials and Methods, and Fig. ) did not match with gp30/40, indicating that they belonged to an additional protein present in the preparation.	1
These novel inhibitors that block AKT membrane localization and activation could have major implications in cancer, diabetes and obesity research.	3
We have shown that depletion of Pak1/2 affects sensitivity to the Eg5 inhibitor monastrol ( and ), as we have seen previously for Tiam1 depletion .	1
Our results showed that GST-RhoAΔD pulled down substantially less phosphorylated ERK and total ERK compared with wild type GST-RhoA, indicating that the docking site is required for the interaction between RhoA and ERK.	1
Ruffling, however, could be restored upon reexpression of Eps8, but not of an Eps8 mutant unable to bind to E3b1 ( ), suggesting that the Eps8-E3b1-based complex is implicated in the transmission of signal between Ras and Rac.	3
As show in A, both the basal and the EGF-induced levels of Rac-GTP were increased by the expression of wild-type Abi1, consistent with the notion that Abi1 is rate-limiting in Rac activation ( ).	1
Our results show that, as previously described , , endogenous Net1 is highly enriched in the nucleus, whereas other GEFs, such as p115 RhoGEF, are restricted to the post nuclear supernatant fraction ( ) .	1
Thus, these results demonstrate that PAK4 induces CDDP resistance in gastric cancer cells via activation of MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways. (A and B) The effects of the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor LY294002 (LY) or the MEK/ERK inhibitor PD98509 (PD) alone or combination with the PAK4 inhibitor PF-3758309 (PF) on CDDP cytotoxicity in AGS/CDDP and MKN-45/CDDP cells detected by MTT assay after 48-h incubation, respectively.	1
B demonstrates that expression of pp29/30 is strongly impaired in T Cell Receptor-modulated PBLCPCS compared with untreated cells.	1
Therefore, together these data suggest that activation of either the phosphoinositide-3-kinase or the Raf pathway is sufficient to decrease CD24 mRNA expression but the Raf pathway is the major repressor of CD24 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels.	2
Yet our data indicates that, though rare, patients with HRAS mutated tumors of different tumor histology might benefit from targeted therapy.	3
These data show that IGF1R-evoked mTOR activation is a key driver of resistance to BYL719 in these models.Fig. 3BYL719 resistance of breast cancer cell lines is dependent on IGF1R activity. a BYL719 dose-responses of parental and resistant lines after 3 days of treatment in the presence or absence of insulin in the culture media.	1
Even though the overall structural organization of the p110β RAS-binding domain is conserved ( ), we speculated that because we cannot detect any interaction with RAS, it might have lost or altered its function.	3
It is possible that the failure to recruit p120 reduces adhesion by inhibiting cadherin clustering, as has been proposed by .	2
We hypothesized that the ST loop might interact with the kinase domain when phosphorylated on Ser487//S487.	3
We show here that ASPP2 is phosphorylated by the RAS/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and that this phosphorylation leads to its increased translocation to the cytosol/nucleus and increased binding to p53, providing an explanation of how RAS can activate p53 pro-apoptotic functions ( ).	2
That the majority of T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule indeed is included in a complex with TCR-CD3-ζ was shown in a preclearing experiment where depletion of CD3-ε resulted in an ∼70% reduction of detectable T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule in lysates of PBLCPCS cells (Fig. ).	1
Strikingly, expression of wild-type Bam32 inhibited B cell antigen receptor-induced activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells in a dose-dependent manner ( A), suggesting that modulation of Bam32 dose during B cell differentiation ( ) could affect the outcome of B cell antigen receptor ligation.	3
A milder phenotype of p110β-RAS-binding domain-DM mice is after all not unexpected, given that the RAS-binding domain mutations do not disrupt basal p110β activity or RAS-binding domain-independent activation routes, and some p110β activity might be enough for normal development and life under controlled conditions.	3
Interestingly, a number of Pak substrates have been described that could influence microtubule function including MCAK , TCoB , stathmin and GEF-H1 (ref. ).	3
It was recently shown that low doses Raf inhibitors stimulated ERK in cells that harbor wild-type Raf and/or activated Ras.	1
We previously reported that the novel, orally available Heat shock protein90α/β inhibitor TAS-116 shows significant anti-MM activities.	1
A specific anti-phosphorylated Y542//Y542 Shp2 antibody was also used to confirm that Y542 of Shp2 is phosphorylated.	1
These findings do not exclude that a possible direct activation of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase by HGF/cMet receptor signaling may also contribute to Rac activation.	2
However, we recently demonstrated that the interaction between p27 and stathmin indirectly affects RhoA activity in mouse fibroblasts.	1
Results showed that adenovirus interfering BMP9 induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT was reversed by PD98059 (P<0.05) and LY294002 (P<0.05) independently ( ).	1
Previous studies in T cells demonstrated that all four distal tyrosines of linker for activation of T cells were necessary for optimal signaling ( ).	1
Another study demonstrated that in high-grade prostate adenocarcinomas, 46% of them showed higher nuclear hypoxia inducible factor 1α immunostaining, and 89% expressed higher levels of VEGF [ ].	1
When plated at high density, confluent cells expressing wild-type and mutant cadherins appeared to have similar if not identical cell contacts, showing that p120-uncoupled cadherins were not markedly deficient in establishing cell-cell contacts.	1
In addition, Ogawa et al. also show that the glucocorticoid receptor represses a large set of functionally related inflammatory response genes by disrupting p65-interferon regulatory factor complexes ( ).	1
To address this question, it was necessary to ectopically express HER2 so that the impact of HER2 overexpression could be compared in the same cell line.	3
We found that cancer cell lines with low levels of NDRG2 show high levels of phosphorylated PTEN-Ser380/Thr382/Thr383 and AKT-Ser473 ( ).	1
Furthermore, we showed that the Ste20 kinase NIK (Nck-interacting kinase) couples EphB1 to c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and integrin activation ( ).	1
We previously showed that the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 targets both myeloma cells and the bone marrow microenvironment milieu [ ].	1
From the second, we conclude that MED23 is not essential for the interaction between Elk-1 and MED14, nor, apparently, for MED14 phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure S7b), and infer that the crucial role of MED23 is not as intermediary in the recruitment of Mediator by Elk-1.	1
We have previously shown that calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase purified from pig brain could activate AMP-activated protein kinase in cell-free assays (albeit poorly in comparison to the extent to which it activates its known substrate, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I); but the AMP-activated protein kinase kinase previously purified from rat liver was not calmodulin-dependent [ ].	3
Clone 3 showed an intermediate phenotype and moderate levels of MAP kinase activation that were associated with intermediate levels of Tiam1.	1
Strikingly, Eps8 knockdown A2780 and H1299 cells were unaffected by MEK1/2 inhibition, and showed a similar capacity to migrate and invade a 3D extracellular matrix when compared to untreated control knockdown cells ( ), indicating that the Sos1-Eps8-Abi1 complex is critical MEK inhibition-induced phenotype reversion.	1
The same result was obtained with LKB1 that had been co-expressed with mouse protein 25-α or MO25β (lanes 4 and 5), which was expected as these proteins do not interact with LKB1 in the absence of STRADα/β [ ].	2
Concomitantly, EphB1 activation also increased Grb2 binding to p52Shc ( B), indicating that the Grb2 complex may be recruited to EphB1 either directly or indirectly through p52Shc.	2
Another possibility is that Bam32 could modulate nuclear factor of activated T cells activation by regulating Ca2+-independent signaling events downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, such as Akt activation .	3
While this work identified candidate substrates of endogenous SRC, all cellular SRC family kinases were inhibited by this inhibitor, so this analysis did not distinguish substrates that are directly downstream of PDGFR activation from those regulated by adhesion receptors and other cellular processes.	1
This study demonstrates that, under basal conditions, Shp2-specific activity is enhanced within the AKAP-Lbc complex, indicating that Shp2 binding to AKAP-Lbc increases its activity.	1
S4 shows that microinjection of anti-Abi1 IgG abrogates PDGF-, but not TPA-induced ruffling.	1
Our earlier studies demonstrated that Ack1 regulates prostate cancer progression to androgen independence by positively regulating androgen receptor and negatively regulating the tumor suppressor, Wwox , , .	1
Thus, antagonists that do not elicit AHR-ARNT dimerization might be more effective repressors of estrogen receptor function than pure agonists as aryl hydrocarbon receptor would not be squelched by ARNT binding.	3
Here, Yu et al. show that activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase leads to the linker phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and their ubiquitin-dependent degradation.	1
FRNK transfectants to support survival on a fibronectin matrix in the absence of serum suggested that the small NH2-terminal segment of FRNK missing in focal adhesion targeting contained a survival sequence.	2
Since blocking IGF1R was sufficient to abrogate the resistance, it is likely that G protein coupled receptors are not involved in p110β activation in our system.	2
We have previously shown that anti-RLIP76 IgG inhibit doxorubicin-transport in in-side-out vesicles .	1
Another exciting possibility is that LKB1:STRAD:MO25 complexes might also act as upstream kinases for other protein kinases, in the same manner that PDK1 phosphorylates threonine residues in the activation loop of a number of kinases of the 'AGC' subfamily [ ].	3
However, we cannot exclude that Aurora A may be affected by Pak knockdown at other temporal stages, or whether both Pak1 and Pak2 need to be depleted to see an effect on Aurora A activity.	2
This combination of these two mutants has allowed us to identify not only processes that can be affected by PTEN's protein phosphatase activity, but to identify processes that appear to require both activities acting together.	2
The earlier studies have demonstrated that loss of c-Cbl alone is dispensable for normal embryonic development ( ) where loss of both c-Cbl and Cbl-b was embryonic lethal before E10.5 (Naramura et al., 2002).	1
Whole genome sequencing of a number of primary medulloblastoma tumors representing all the four subgroups further revealed that mutations in different epigenetic modifiers may distinguish Medulloblastoma subgroups 3 and 4, thus presenting potential for targeting of subgroup-specific alterations for therapeutic benefit .	2
Our analysis showed that leaking Choroidal neovascularization were found in 10/14 (71%) lesions in the c-Cbl knockout mice as compared to 6/18 lesions (33%) in the wild type mice ( ).	1
This model implies that targeting 14-3-3ζ or pathways regulated by 14-3-3ζ may be effective anti-cancer strategies in patients whose tumors overexpress 14-3-3ζ.	2
We identified a novel mechanism of Shp2 inhibition that may promote cardiac hypertrophy.	2
We investigated this latter hypothesis using the Shp2-specific inhibitor to demonstrate that, if Shp2 is responsible for deactivating FGFR2 in Grb2i cells, then its inhibition would allow mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation to be restored to its normal level.	1
Accordingly, no phosphorylation of ERK (motif: pTEpY) or p38 kinase (motif: pTGpY) was detectable in syncytia (data not shown), indicating that these kinases are not activated.	1
There are other mechanisms that could account for how KLF5 regulates hypoxia inducible factor 1α protein, including transcriptional regulation, miRNA and hypoxia.	3
These data suggest that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway plays a critical role in MKP3 expression induced by active Ras activation.	2
Taken together, these results demonstrate that Y600//Y600 and Y778//Y778 are indispensable for the recruitment of c-Src and p52Shc to EphB1 signaling complexes, and thus are important regulators of EphB1-dependent ERK activation and cell migration.	1
One explanation for this could be that the binding of Grb2 to FGFR2 stabilizes receptor dimers, increasing the probability of active signaling on growth factor stimulation.	3
Consistent with the enrichment of Forkhead box O transcription factors, we observed that CCNG2, KLHL24, DDIT3, CITED2 and RICTOR were significantly upregulated.	1
We found that the Gab2 ΔPI3K expressing cells displayed impaired migration and invasion compared to Gab2 wild type expressing cells ( ), indicating that Gab2 via activation of PI3K, promotes the migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells.	1
Thus, one could envision a therapeutic strategy comprising inhibitors of Raf or MEK that are currently used in the clinic with a SMYD3 inhibitory agent, which could mitigate potential drug toxicity by lowering the overall dose needed for each medicine and combat the development of resistance.	3
Coprecipitation experiments performed under conditions that preserve the integrity of the TCR-CD3-ζ complex (Fig. A) confirmed our previous assumption that T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule physically associates with the T Cell Receptor.	1
Our previous studies demonstrated that RAS-G12V-transformed HME1 cells require sustained FAM83B expression to maintain a transformed phenotype, implicating FAM83B as a key component in RAS/MAPK signaling.	1
Nonetheless, the data also suggest that E-cadherin might regulate an alternative function for p120 in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus by sequestering it at cell-cell junctions.	3
These data indicated that 14-3-3ζ overexpression led to increased phosphoinositide 3-kinase activation by increasing phosphoinositide 3-kinase membrane localization. 14-3-3 proteins frequently modulate protein subcellular localization by binding to target proteins.	1
These data provide further evidence that that a feedback loop initiated by MEK-ERK signalling acts to modulate migratory behaviour through a negative effect on the Sos1-Eps8-Abi1 complex, in agreement with the model prediction.	1
In addition, a recent study showed that hypoxia-induced IL-18 increases Rac1 activity and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α expression in a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt-dependent manner .	1
Shi YH. et al. also reported that bFGF induces hypoxia-inducible factor-1α activation and VEGF release in T47D breast cancer cell line involves phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt and MEK1/ERK pathways .	1
In preliminary experiments, we showed that the phospho-Ser769/773/775 antibody displays the strongest preference for triple phospho-Ser peptides (data not shown).	1
Here, we show that KRas, but not HRas, acutely translocates from the plasma membrane to the Golgi complex and early/recycling endosomes in response to neuronal activity.	1
It can be speculated that this signaling logic might provide an improved ability to amplify a weak signal input or might increase the possibility for fine-tuning the signal through crosstalk of other pathways onto components such as Dock180/Elmo1, RAC itself, or RAC-GAPs terminating RAC activity.	3
Interestingly, kinetic analysis of Src-induced podosome formation in NIH-3T3 cells has indicated that clustering of PtdIns(3,4)P2 is an early and necessary event in podosome formation.	1
This suggests that Y700//Y700 and Y774//Y774 on c-Cbl but not Y731 are engaged in c-Cbl-dependent biological functions in endothelial cells.	2
Work by and has shown that in fibroblasts, T cells, and PC12 cells, ER/Golgi-localized HRas signaling is engaged in response to growth receptors or T cell receptor activation at the plasma membrane.	1
However, work by suggests that the juxtamembrane domain negatively regulates adhesion activity and that p120 may be directly responsible for this effect ( ; ).	2
Tacrolimus, also known as FK506 or Prograf, is a 822 Da, 23-membered macrolide compound (C44H69NO12) that was isolated from a soil microorganism Streptomyces tsukubaensis in Japan in 1984, [ , ].	1
In this study, we also showed that HSP20 associated with the phosphoinositide 3-kinase p85 subunit and phosphoinositide 3-kinase p110 subunit in the heat shock protein20-overexpressing hepatocellular carcinoma cell line.	1
Based on our results, it is probable that the interaction of HSP20 with phosphoinositide 3-kinase and its inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity in hepatocellular carcinoma might play significant role in hepatocellular carcinoma development.	3
These results suggest that Gab2 expression promotes migratory and invasive growth, signs of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, in ovarian cancer cells.	2
As inhibition of SAF-1 can suppress Ras and VEGF expression, these findings offer a new possibility for cancer therapy by targeting SAF-1/MAZ function that may provide an improved treatment option for cancer.	2
We also reported that theophylline might restore glucocorticoid sensitivity via enhancement of histone deacetylase activity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease macrophages ( ).	3
Sos-1 might be the GEF involved, as witnessed by the observations that it forms a tricomplex with Eps8 and the scaffolding protein E3b1 in vivo and that this tricomplex is endowed with Rac-GEF activity in vitro ( ).	3
These results were confirmed by in vivo Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, which demonstrated that SAF-1 interacts at the G-rich sequences that are present upstream of the transcription start site in these two Ras promoters (Fig. and D).	1
FRET data indicates that these observed migration/invasion effects of Eps8 siRNA are also via leading edge Rac1 and RhoA dynamics, as predicted (Figs and , ).	1
Collectively, this study evaluated the capacity of TAK165 to synergize with all-trans retinoic acid in acute myeloid leukemia cells and induce differentiation, and thus, suggests that this combination therapy is a promising approach as a future differentiation therapy.	2
Several studies demonstrate that the inhibition of the HER2 pathway may be a potential therapeutic for leukemia.	1
Western blot analyses confirmed that the expression of E-cadherin was partially restored and the expression of vimentin, MMP7 and MMP9 was reduced upon using U0126 in SW480-Gab2 cells (Fig. ).	1
Recently, Park et al. [ ] reported that PAK4 enhanced survival and decreased apoptosis following chemotherapy in prostate cancer.	1
Our RT-PCR assays indicated that Rac1 T17N did not have any effect on the mRNA expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, However, Rac1 T17N significantly attenuated hypoxia-induced increase in VEGF mRNA transcript levels ( ).	1
Results showed that fangchinoline significantly decreased invasion and migration potential of gastric cancer SGC7901 cells ( ) in a dose-dependent manner, but weakly decreased invasion and migration potential of MKN45 cells ( ).	1
Previous studies have shown that Net1 is regulated via phosphorylation by PAK1, which inhibits its exchange activity .	1
Using AZD6244 as a representative inhibitor, we found that AMG655 potently reduced cell survival, induced cleavage of caspase-8, caspase-3 and PARP and increased DNA fragmentation in BCPAP, TPC-1 and LOXIMVI cells pre-exposed to DMSO control solvent, whereas overnight pretreatment with AZD2644 abrogated these effects of AMG655 ( ).	1
Third, of the two tandem mass spectrometry- derived peptides finally found to belong to T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule (Figs. and ), only the 25-amino acid tryptic peptide was suitable for designing oligonucleotides that could be used in reverse transcription PCR reactions.	3
These data demonstrate that Ret9 and Shank3 interact in a PDZ domain-mediated fashion, and that this interaction is direct.	1
Following immunoprecipitation using an anti-PRL-3 antibody, we performed western blot analysis for phosphotyrosine. shows that endogenous PRL-3 can be phosphorylated on tyrosine.	2
However, the location of the residues at the ends of the loop (Glu469 and Val524) in this structure show that they lie close to the kinase domain, being approximately 20 and 40 Å (1 Å=0.1 nm) from Thr172//T172 respectively ( A).	1
Previously, we found that 14-3-3ζ overexpression increased Akt phosphorylation in human mammary epithelial cells.	1
Similar results were also observed in p53-null H1299 lung cancer cells ( ), suggesting that the p53-R273H contact mutant, but not the p53-R175H conformational mutant, confers anoikis resistance in human cancer cells.	2
Thus, these data suggest that the inhibition of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase pathway could potentially activate a repressor or inhibit an activator of CD24 mRNA expression to block the effects of U0126 treatment.	3
Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated that ERK2, but not ERK1, reduced E-cadherin levels via Fra1-mediated ZEB1/2 in a nontransformed human mammary epithelial cell line, MCF-10A cells .	1
Targeting RLIP76 is also a quite unique strategy because to date, there are no other targeting modalities that show such a broad spectrum of activity (lung, colon, prostate, kidney, melanoma, neuroblastoma, and pancreas) in both cell cultures and animal models, with inherent cancer specificity - , , .	1
However, a number of papers demonstrate that loss of one of these signaling molecules does not ablate mast cell signaling completely.	1
Of note, the microarray results show that BCL2-modifying factor expression was upregulated while p53 mRNA was downregulated following knockdown of p53-R273H in MDA-MB-468 cells, independently validating our previous results which demonstrated that depletion of p53-R273H induces BCL2-modifying factor mRNA and protein expression.	1
We have previously shown that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in triple negative breast cancer cells is regulated, at least in part, by SAF-1 (serum amyloid A activating factor 1) transcription factor.	1
Although our data does not preclude the possibility of cytoplasmic Erk phosphorylation of smad linker region, followed by a rapid nuclear translocation, this seems unlike in that previously cytoplasmic smad2 linker phosphorylation has been shown to be associated with exclusion from the nucleus , .	1
In this study, we found that PAK4 induces CDDP resistance in gastric cancer cells, mainly through activation of PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways.	1
In this study, our results demonstrated that HER2 elevated COX-2 expression through the activation of MEK/ERK pathway, which subsequently induced cell proliferation and invasion via AKT pathway.	1
These data provide clear evidence that TDRG1 is upregulated in testicular seminoma tissues.	1
These data suggest that p38 activation likely precedes JNK activation, and taken together indicate that activation of both the pro-apoptotic MAPKs contribute to the Medulloblastoma cell growth inhibitory effects of CARP-1 functional mimetic-4.	2
We found that Bad was phosphorylated on serine 111//S111 in all of the cell lines except RT-4, which expressed very low levels of BAD ( lane 1; data not shown for RT-4 cells).	1
Here we show that methylation of MAP3K2 by SMYD3 increases MAP Kinase signaling and promotes the formation of Ras-driven carcinomas.	1
Consistent with a direct role of the prenyl moiety in CaM recognition, we found that substitution of the prenylated cysteine to an alanine in the CaaX motif significantly reduced binding of CFP-KRas-tail to Ca2+/calmodulin ( a).	1
We have already shown ( ) and confirm here that Lck is the primary Src family protein tyrosine kinase regulating the tyrosine phosphorylation of the T cell antigen receptor-ζ chain and ZAP-70, whereas Fyn has only a minor redundant role in regulating these events (Fig. , A and B).	1
Using this unbiased quantification method, we could show that Rac activity was low at the leading edge of cells moving on 3D extracellular matrix, whereas RhoA activity was high when Rab-coupling protein-driven trafficking of α5β1 and EGFR1 was promoted in A2780 cells upon cRGDfV treatment ( , ) or in H1299 cells upon expression of mutant p53 ( ), in agreement with our previous observations [ ].	3
It is thus possible that KLF5 modulates angiogenesis during prostatic tumorigenesis.	2
Here we show that ASPP2 is a novel substrate of mitogen-activated protein kinase .	1
FAM83B-mediated anchorage-independent growth was significantly diminished following inhibition of either PI3K or AKT activity, confirming that the hyperactivated AKT observed in FAM83B-expressing cells is critical for FAM83B-mediated transformation.	1
In addition, RAS-binding domain mutations have been used to demonstrate that input of RAS binding to the single Drosophila type I phosphoinositide 3-kinase is critical in insulin-pathway-controlled developmental growth ( ) and that RAS binding is required for phosphoinositide 3-kinase activation by chemoattractants in Dictyostelium ( ). p110β has been much less thoroughly studied than p110α.	1
Hemizygous deletion induces haploinsufficiency of KLF5 [ , ], and our recent publication demonstrated that hemizygous deletion of Klf5 in mouse prostates indeed promotes tumor development [ ].	1
It should be noted that the observed downregulation of Rac activity by RasV12 does not exclude a requirement for Rac in invasion and migration of cells.	2
These data suggest that mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways, invoked in response to CXCR4 signaling, are required for morphological changes in response to CXCR4 signaling.	2
In addition, the motif analysis validated the inclusion of phosphopeptides with fold change values 1.32-1.55 and provided evidence that these sites may be SRC regulated since many closely match the SRC consensus motif.	2
However, these studies did not provide definitive proof that the Ser485//S485/Ser487//S487 phosphorylation and the reduced Thr172//T172 phosphorylation observed in the intact cells were causally related.	1
Band density measurements from at least three independent experiments showed that EGF-induced total receptor autophosphorylation was lower by approximately 25% in the HER2 cells ( ).	1
To avoid any possible misinterpretation due to the increased proteasomal degradation of p27threonine 198A, we compared the activity of p27threonine 198E and p27threonine 198V that have a similar expression and a similar half-life in our cell lines ( , , ).	2
The remaining genes EGFR, GSK3A, GSK3B, PIK3C3, PRKAB1, SRC, STK11, TSC1, and TSC2 were individually selected from EGFR/ERBB/AMPK signaling pathways (KEGG ). shows a characterization of our 20 genes in terms of their Gene Ontology annotation (biological processes), demonstrating an involvement of all proteins into biological processes that are associated with tumor development and cell growth (see full Gene Ontology annotation in file S5).	1
SW480 cells stably expressing wild-type PRL-3 or a mutant lacking tyrosine 53 (Y53F) were evaluated for their ability to invade through Matrigel. shows that wild-type PRL-3 promoted a 4-5-fold increase in the invasiveness of SW480 cells, whereas the Y53F mutant promoted an increase of only 40% that of WT, indicating that phosphorylation at this site is likely required for full PRL-3-induced invasion.	1
Our studies show that inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in combination with CXCR2 or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in combination with MEK1/2 reversed the stellate phenotype of CXCR4-expressing MCF-7 cells in 3D rBM cultures.	1
Similar to our previous observations, we found that treatment of RasV12 with LY294002 reduced phosphorylation of Akt with no effect on phosphorylation of ERK.	1
Our data suggest that inhibition of various components of the IGFR/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mTOR pathway is more efficacious than inhibition of p110α alone.	2
We confirm that FAK is required for transduction of signals from serum as well as from fibronectin.	1
Here, we show that Abi1 (also known as E3b1) recruits phosphoinositide 3-kinase, via p85, into a multimolecular signaling complex that includes Eps8 and Sos-1.	1
Finally, the receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent relocalization of the macromolecular complex at sites where membrane ruffling takes place ( B; for review see ) suggests that the recruitment of the complex to proper sites within the cell's formation is key for signal propagation, further ensuring that the production of PIP3 is directed to and modulates the activation of Rac-GEFs, and thereby of Rac, in a defined microenvironment.	2
In summary, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of p53 on serine 15 by mTOR/FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein plays a critical role in syncytial apoptosis driven by human immunodeficiency virus-1 envelope glycoprotein complex.	1
These data indicated that tyrosine phosphorylation at Y64//Y64 may be a negative regulatory input for membrane extension that has a separate mechanism from the status of GTP-binding.	2
Western blotting was also used to verify that the anti-pJNK did not cross react with pFAK.	1
In ovarian cancer cells, we find that the Gab2-Shp2 pathway is not required for E-cadherin downregulation and increased Zeb1 expression ( ).	1
Quantitative analysis demonstrated that mutants containing p27threonine 198A/G displayed a half-life of about 2.5 hours respect to the 7-9 hours of p27threonine 198V, p27WT or p27threonine 198E.	1
Our analysis shows that VEGF stimulation of endothelial cells selectively induces phosphorylation of c-Cbl at Y700 and Y774 but not Y731.	1
We further observed that hypoxia not only enhanced the protein level of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α in the cytoplasm and but also increased its redistribution from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.	1
Mechanism-based inhibitors that target cancer dependencies have been shown to be effective and well tolerated in several clinical trials but, unfortunately, most did not provide long-lasting therapy.	1
This supports results obtained in cell-free assays ( C), and shows that the effect in intact cells is independent of the upstream kinase utilized.	1
BLAST sequence similarity searching (available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) indicated that the Bam32 src homology 2 domain is most highly related (30-37% identity) to those of the adaptor protein Nck, phospholipase Cγ1, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85 subunit, and the protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2.	1
Also, these findings provide evidence that Lck and Fyn have functional specificities during T cell antigen receptor signaling.	1
These data indicates that Gab2 may enhance colorectal cancer cells metastasis through the ERK/MMP pathway.Fig. 5Gab2 expression regulates ERK signaling and increases MMP7 and MMP9 expression in colorectal cancer cells. a Gab2 overexpression enhances MMP7 and MMP9 expression and activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2, whereas knockdown of Gab2 inhibits MMP7 and MMP9 expression and reduces extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 activation. b and c The levels of phosphor‑AKT, phosphor‑ERK1/2, MMP7 and MMP9 were calculated.	2
These data collectively suggest that although these Medulloblastoma cells express TrkC-like peptides, the elevated levels of NTF3 following treatments with CARP-1 functional mimetic-4 or CARP-1 functional mimetic-5 are not likely to be involved in extrinsic, receptor-dependent growth inhibitory signaling.	2
Utilizing double mutant PKA phosphodeficient (T73A/S189A) and phosphomimetic (T73D/S189D) constructs, in vitro binding assays, and phosphatase activity assays, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of these residues disrupts Shp2 interaction with tyrosine-phosphorylated ligands and inhibits its protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity.	1
MED14 knockdown did not affect the expression of Mcl1, which in these cells was relatively high and unresponsive to serum stimulation (Supplementary Figure S4), indicating that MED14 depletion does not inactivate Mediator per se.	1
The model is consistent with the sequential phosphorylation model in which the primary kinase phosphorylates a residue that is directly recognized by the secondary phosphate-directed kinase.	1
We previously reported that the expression levels of HSP20 in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells inversely correlated with the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma, and that HSP20 suppresses the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells via the AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways.	1
Crucially in terms of drug development and potential development as a novel therapeutic, ETP-45658 obeys Lipinski's Rule of Five, suggesting that ETP-45658 could serve as therapeutic agent [ ].	3
To identify the region in Ack1 that recognize AKT, mouse embryonic fibroblast1&2KO cells were transfected with Myc-tagged Ack1 deletions (shown in ) and HA-tagged AKT.	1
The phosphorylation of PTEN at the serine-threonine cluster (Ser370, Ser380, Thr382, Thr383 and Ser385) in the C-terminal tail suppresses its phosphatase activity ; therefore, we evaluated PTEN phosphorylation and demonstrated that the cluster sites were highly phosphorylated in the primary adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma cells and adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma cell lines, whereas the non-phosphorylated form was lower in abundance compared with controls ( ; ).	1
In centrosomal fractions, the same antibodies also stained a slightly lower molecular weight protein that may be a proteolytic product of p160ROCK or a centrosomal variant of this protein. (B) Immunostaining of HeLa GFP-centrin cells (a) with N6 antibody (b).	2
This is therapeutically relevant, since it has been shown that, while exerting antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in combination with EGFR-inhibitors, single agent metformin treatment could enhance proliferating signals through the RAS/RAF/mitogen-activated-protein-kinase pathway, that could in turn induce cell proliferation in those cell lines with constitutively activating Ras mutations.	3
These results are consistent with our finding that p85 binding to Gab1 does not influence the recruitment of Shp2 to the Gab1 signaling complex, and are inconsistent with the conclusion that Gab1 mediates a phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-dependent recruitment of Shp2 [ ].	1
We found that Sirt1 gene expression levels increased from grade I to grade III brain tumour tissues ( , black bars), but not in grade IV as compared to normal brain tissue ( , white bars).	1

More recent studies have found that Pak stimulation of serine 112//S112 phosphorylation may be indirect, proceeding through Raf-1 , .	2
Results showed that the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT was inhibited by the specific inhibitors independently.	1
Although it has been reported that inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin can enhance the definitive endoderm specification of human embryonic stem cells , chronic exposure of human embryonic stem cells to rapamycin over several days will also inhibit mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 activity , which may ultimately be the reason for the reported improvement in definitive endoderm specification.	2
It could be argued that Tiam1 downregulation is due to the phenotypic changes induced by RasV12 or RafCAAX expression in cells (see ), rather than by sustained Raf/MAP kinase signaling.	3
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts from p110β RAS-binding domain mutant mice show reduced phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity and mice are resistant to bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, a pathology that has been linked with lysophosphatidic acid signaling.	1
We therefore confirmed that phosphoinositide 3-kinase acts upstream of AKT in the hepatocellular carcinoma cells.	1
We found that knockdown of CHOP, Elk1 or both abrogated the ability of PLX4032 to increase Death receptor 5 expression in A549 cells ( ), indicating the dependency of Death receptor 5 induction by PLX4032 on both CHOP and Elk1.	1
In that case, we confirm work of others that survival signals are transduced by FAK, phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase , and Akt/protein kinase B (PKB).	1
Numerous correlative studies in tumors of the colon, stomach, breast, pancreas and ovaries have shown that PRL-3 expression increases with tumor progression (reviewed in , ).	1
While ~90% inhibition in Sirt1 gene expression was observed in siSirt1-transfected cells ( ), we found that resveratrol inhibitory potential was significantly diminished in those cells which had Sirt1 expression silenced ( , closed circles) in comparison to Mock-transfected cells ( , open circles).	1
This suggests that ASPP2 binding to RAS at the plasma membrane occurs prior to mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation of ASPP2 and that Ser 827 phosphorylation is required for RAS-induced translocation of ASPP2 to the cytosol. (A) RAS activation induces cytoplasmic and nuclear translocation of wild-type ASPP2 but not ASPP2 (S827A) in HKe3 ER:HRAS12 cells as detected by immunofluorescence.	2

Previous studies have also demonstrated that the proliferative response observed after sublethal toxicant-induced renal injury may be mediated by activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling pathway, which is ultimately regulated by bioenergetic capacity [ - ].	1
The mechanisms that underlie this translocation process are potentially applicable to a number of other signaling proteins, and may provide a molecular and cellular basis for signaling specificity of a variety of lipid-modified signaling molecules in neurons.	2
We found that the S1466A mutant of Tiam1 was unable to rescue the increased intercentrosomal distance seen on Tiam1 depletion in both prophase ( ) and prometaphase ( ).	1

To test model robustness and determine that the RhoA dominant cyclic activity of Rac1 and RhoA was not caused by the synchronous updating scheme used in Boolean simulations, we introduced inherent stochasticity into the model by using random asynchronous updates (whereby in any time increment, the next executable reaction will be chosen at random).	2
Previous work with Shp2 -/- cells demonstrated an elevated and sustained activation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and Akt in response to EGF treatment, and it was proposed that Shp2 may act to dephosphorylate Gab1 at one or both of the p85 binding sites [ ].	1
Our data suggest that aryl hydrocarbon receptor and ARNT act independently from each other at off-target sites and we revealed that ARNT is not essential for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-dependent repression of estrogen receptor-signaling.	2
Increasing evidences have confirmed that PAKs are closely correlated with cancer development.	1
A dendrogram showing the relationships between catalytic domain sequences of 518 human protein kinases encoded in the human genome [ ] shows that the AMP-activated protein kinaseα1 and AMP-activated protein kinaseα2 subunits lie on a small sub-branch also containing eight other protein kinases (NuaK1, NuaK2, BrsK1, BrsK2, SIK, QIK, QSK and MELK), most of which either have not been studied previously or have very little known about them.	1
Similarly, it has been shown that Akt phosphorylates FoxO Forkhead transcription factors, and this promotes their interaction with 14-3-3, leading to their nuclear exit and cytoplasmic retention ( ; ).	1

Interestingly, we found that cells survive if they overexpress FRNK, even though FRNK, like focal adhesion targeting, lacks a kinase domain.	1
We hypothesized that effects of arsenic on birth weight may be related to effects on myogenic differentiation.	3
These data suggested us that the presence of a small amino-acid in the last residue of p27 protein resulted in increased proteasome dependent degradation and that this process was independent from the phosphorylation of Threonine 187.	2

Immunoprecipitation studies further revealed that EGFR lacking the Grb2 binding site interacts poorly with c-Cbl and is least ubiquitinylated ( ), explaining the observed resistance to ligand-induced degradation.	2
While these data do not definitively disprove this model, we believe that our data suggest that it is unlikely because co-activator competition cannot account for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-inducible repression in ECC-1 cells as activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor should squelch ARNT's co-repressor function.	3
However, an in vitro assay performed using either CyclinA2/CDK2 or Cyclin D1/CDK4 recombinant complexes, demonstrated that the ability of p27WT, p27threonine 198A, p27threonine 198G, p27threonine 198D or p27threonine 198V recombinant proteins to inhibit the CDKs kinase activity was comparable in all mutants ( ).	1
To exclude the possibility that our result could be explained by a loss of proper conformation due to the deletion, we performed peptide competition experiments utilizing a peptide consisting of the amino acids of B56γ from 376 to 402 (peptide B56γ, ).	3
Because p120 does not directly associate with α-catenin, it is likely that it binds other proteins which in turn act to regulate and remodel the actin-cadherin interface.	2
Thus, the sum of the above observation raises the possibility that Sos-1 might function at different step in the signaling cascade, acting as a Ras-GEF and a Rac-GEF, respectively.	3

Adding to this understanding, we observed that deletion of the DH domain (ΔDH) increases P-REX1 binding to PIP3, and facilitates interaction with other phosphatidylinositol species ( ), suggesting that the DH domain regulates interactions of the pleckstrin homology domain with lipid membranes.	2
Our initial observation showed that IQGAP1 is tyrosine phosphorylated in PAE cells by VEGFR-2 and mutation of Y1057 reduces the ability of VEGFR-2 to stimulate its tyrosine phosphorylation ( ).	1
In these cells, we found that PAK4 levels were significantly higher than those in their parental cells.	1
As with LMW-PTP, phosphorylation of PRL-3 could also create new binding sites for proteins containing Src homology-2 domains, such that PRL-3 may act as a membrane-associated scaffolding protein as well as a phosphatase.	2
As the canonical ERK1/2 activation pathway consists of Raf-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 and both SMYD3 and MAP3K2 were required for MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 activation but not CRaf, we postulated that SMYD3 methylation of MAP3K2 directly influences MEK1/2 phosphorylation.	2
Our data suggest that oncogenic Ras is able to induce a mesenchymal phenotype in epithelial MDCK cells by influencing the balance between the activation state of Rac and Rho proteins.	2
Here we reveal the Mediator subunit MED14 as a novel ERK substrate, detect Elk-1 interactions with MED14 that are independent of MED23, demonstrate inducible phosphorylation of MED14 at immediate early gene promoters and provide evidence for its positive role in mitogen-responsive gene transcription.	1

The DNA-binding activity and transactivation potential of this mutated SAF-1 protein has earlier been shown to be markedly less than that of wild type SAF-1 .	1
This led to the discovery that the CaMKKs [CaMK (Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase) kinases], especially CaMKKβ, could act as alternative upstream kinases that can phosphorylate Thr172 on AMPK [ - ].	3
This suggests that discrepancy found in the literature regarding Sirt1 expression in tissue samples may be explained by the invasive stage status of a given tumour.	2
Substrates that correlated with SRC activation, such as p120, Hrs, p130Cas, FRK and KIAA0323, may be critical mediators of SRC activity in human tumors.	2

Taken together, these findings indicated that TAK165 inhibits the proliferation of acute myeloid leukemia cells, which is in parallel with a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest without cytotoxicity.	1
Taken together our findings demonstrate for the first time that a cancer derived mutant of B56γ3 lacks the physiologically significant p53-dependent tumor suppressive function, providing evidence for the importance of this pathway in protecting cells from a cancerous phenotype.	1
Therefore, our results suggest that Syk activated by Lyn phosphorylates HS1 directly in BCRmediated signaling.	2
Consistent with our findings, previous studies also observed that TAK165 significantly inhibited tumor growth compared with Herceptin in urological cancers with weak HER2 expression , and TAK165-inhibted cell proliferation might be regulated by the suppression of ERK phosphorylation instead of HER2 inhibition .	3
Constitutive phosphorylation of mutant EGFR on Y1068 (see A), the binding site for the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase interacting protein Gab1 [ ], indicated that signaling pathways downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase might be constitutively activated as well.	3
Therefore, a structural modification of TAK165 that maintains its synergistic ability in differentiation but does not target HER2 should be performed to better understand the specific mechanisms of TAK165 in enhancing the differentiation induced by all-trans retinoic acid.	2
Taken together, our results suggest that FAM83B has additional, growth promoting and transforming functions that are independent of the previously described RAF/MAPK activation.	2

Another recent study showed that prostaglandin E2 , the production of COX-2, was also involved in the activation of PI3K/AKT pathway.	1
As shown in , an anti-pan-14-3-3 antibody that recognizes all isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins reacted equally with both bands (lane 1), but an anti-14-3-3ε-specific antibody detected the upper band more intensely (lane 2), which suggests that both 14-3-3ε and ζ were copurified with Chibby.	2
Although it has been suggested that ERK1/2 nuclear translocation is mediated by passive diffusion of monomers, active transport of dimers and an interaction with nuclear pore complexes, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.	2
The low level of histamine release in some of the 4YF mice does suggest that there may be some compensatory mechanism in these mice, but not in the totally linker for activation of T cells-deficient mice that allow for some response.	2
S1 shows that the Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 does not inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of EphB1.	1
As the catalytic activity of protein tyrosine phosphatase's can be 1000-fold greater than that of kinases ( ; ), perturbation of activity may have a significantly more profound effect on signal propagation than that of kinases.	2

We also found that Tiam1-His can be phosphorylated just as efficiently by Cdk1-cyclin A as with Cdk1-cyclin B1 ( ).	2
The reciprocal activation between PAK4 and PI3K/AKT pathways may represent a positive regulatory circuit that mutually reinforces the PAK4 and Akt activities to further augment the CDDP resistance in gastric cancer.	2
Taken together, these data show that CARP-1 functional mimetics, in particular CARP-1 functional mimetic-4 and -5, have the ability to interfere with Medulloblastoma cell invasion and metastasis-inducing pathways. (A) Medulloblastoma cells were either untreated (Control) or treated with indicated dose of respective CARP-1 functional mimetics, and were subjected to the subjected to the scratch assays (indicated as wound healing assay; upper panel) or soft-agar assay (lower panel).	1
Together these results confirm that activation of Erk upon TGF-β treatment occurs in phenotypically normal cells of mesenchymal origin, but not epithelial cells. (A) AKR-2B and NIH 3T3 fibroblast were treated with TGF-β (2 ng/ml) for times ranging from 0 to 4 h. 	1
It is possible that CXCR2 continues to activate MEK when phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or CXCR4 is inhibited.	2
By studying the effects of p27WT protein on the regulation of glioblastoma cell growth and motility we observed that the WT protein was able to stimulate the formation of neuron like protrusions in U87MG cells ( ), thus confirming our previous observation that p27 is able to control protrusion formation in 3D context , also in glioblastomas.	2
Additionally, this demonstrates the complex effects of the growth factor mileu on a cell, in that a TGF-β/smad signal may be modulated by the presence of other growth factors acting on the phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase pathway.	1
This suggests that uPAR signals through DOCK180 for uPAR-driven Rac activation and membrane protrusion, resulting in cell motility and invasion.	2
Dysregulation of these genes indicates an enhanced angiogenesis transcription network resulting from Klf5 deletion.Figure 2 Klf5 deletion dysregulates angiogenesis-related genes and enhances hypoxia inducible factor 1α transcriptional activity in Pten-null mouse prostates. (A) Heatmap of genes involved in angiogenesis based on the MetaCore analysis and PubMed publications and that had >1.5 fold change in expression between wildtype and Klf5-null mouse prostates (4 samples per group, indicated at the top).	1

These data imply that CXCR4-independent activation of MEK1 or MEK1/2 works in concert with CXCR4 to drive epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in MCF-7 cells.	1
A recent report by Lee et. al demonstrated that another member of this family, FAM83A, can activate the PI3K signaling axis, leading to AKT phosphorylation [ ].	1
Although there is some conjecture in the field, it has been reported that activated receptor tyrosine kinases phosphorylate tyrosine 542 (Y542) on Shp2, which appears to enhance phosphatase activity ( ; ; ).	2
We could demonstrate that (a) the SH3 of Grb2, but not of Eps8, efficiently competed with the SH3 of E3b1 for binding to the proline-rich COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 in vitro ( B); (b) the Sos-1 peptide VPVPPPVPPRRR, known to constitute a Grb2-SH3 binding site ( ; ), competed equally well the binding of the COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 to the SH3s of Grb2 or E3b1 ( C); (c) the binding constants of the interaction between the proline rich COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 and the SH3 domains of Grb2 and E3b1 were very similar ( D); (d) overexpression of Grb2 abolished the ability of glutathione S-transferase-E3b1 to bind to native Sos-1 ( A); and (e) overexpression of E3b1 significantly decreased the coimmunoprecipitation between Grb2 and Sos-1 ( B).	1
While experimenting with different conditions to optimize recovery at the Q-Sepharose step of our previous purification protocol for AMP-activated protein kinase kinase [ ], we found that we were able to resolve two peaks of activity (Figure ).	1
Thus, ERKs are activated equally in response to matrices that do and do not support survival.	1
Furthermore, confocal microscopy analysis of Orf virus-encoded protein 002 mutants and the detection of low levels of NF-κB p65 (pSer276) in nuclear extracts of cells expressing Orf virus-encoded protein 002 deletion mutants retaining an intact N-terminus confirm that the N-terminus of Orf virus-encoded protein 002 is sufficient to inhibit phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 at Ser276 in the nucleus.	1
Our previous studies have shown that TAS-116 more potently and significantly targets heat shock protein90 client proteins including C-Raf and MEK1/2 in myeloma cell lines than 17-AAG [ ].	1
Based on the evidence, our model ( ) suggests that as Ack1 signaling pathway is initiated at the plasma membrane by Receptor Tyrosine Kinases.	2
Taken together, these data show that the RHO family GTPases RAC1 and CDC42 bind to p110β in an isoform-specific manner and potently and directly stimulate its lipid kinase activity.	1
We have recently reported that Rac1 is phosphorylated on threonine 108 (108T) by extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation.	1
These data suggest that different subsets of kinomes are differentially involved in the pathogenic development of lung adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma.	2
Another study meanwhile has suggested that Eps8 regulates ERK activity which affects migration of breast cancer cells [ ].	2
Our results demonstrate that FGF2 enhances cell invasiveness by down-regulating E-cadherin and that E-cadherin overexpression inhibits basal invasiveness and abolishes FGF2-induced invasion.	1
As a known effector of cell replication, it is interesting that Erk is activated in a cell type known to proliferate in response to TGF-β, but not a growth inhibited cell type, when using the appropriate cellular environment where these responses would occur.	2
Using an in vitro experiment in which purified full-length wild-type Shp2 was incubated with phosphorylated C-terminal SH3 domain domain of Grb2 we demonstrated that Shp2 can dephosphorylate Grb2 on residue Y209 ( ).	1
We observed a clear suppression of CD24 mRNA expression (Figure ) that was over 1000-fold lower in RasV12 cells compared to control cells (Figure ).	1
The absence of tyrosine phosphorylation when GST was used as substrate indicated that Rac1, and not the GST tag, was the phosphorylation target. (A) 5 µg of either GST-Rac1 (lanes 1-5) or GST (lane 6) were incubated with 0 µg (lane1), 0.25 µg (lane 2), 1 µg (lanes 3, 5, 6), or 4 µg (lane 4) of purified Src in kinase buffer.	1
However, our phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase inhibitor studies also showed that phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase is not required for the FAK/Cas-MKK4/JNK matrix survival pathway, which we show is activated when cells adhere to fibronectin and serum is absent.	1
In this study the luciferase assay showed that Orf virus-encoded protein 002 mutants lacking the N-terminus did not inhibit activation of nuclear factors κB, while wild type Orf virus-encoded protein 002 and deletion mutants of Orf virus-encoded protein 002 retaining an intact N-terminus did inhibit activation of nuclear factors κB.	1
Interestingly, X-ray crystallography of the Cdc42-Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor complex shows that the Y64 of Cdc42 is in close proximity to lysine residues at positions 43 and 52 of Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor.	1
Two reports in 2002 have demonstrated that once Rac1 is activated, it is ubiquitylated for targeting to proteasomal degradation. , Indeed, the persistent activation of Rac1, resulting from mutations in position Q61 as well as G12, sensitizes this GTPase to K48-poly-ubiquitylation, thereby reducing its stability.	1
In the converse experiment (which was not reported by Anderson et al. [ ]) we found that no CaMKKβ was detected in an anti-AMPK-α1/α2 immunoprecipitate, although we could readily detect the α, β and γ subunits of AMPK ( A).	3
In addition, the expression level of phosphoinositide 3-kinase p85 mRNA also did not show any significant difference in the cells with HSP20 overexpression compared with that in the control cells ( ).	1
It seems likely that the HSP20 in hepatocellular carcinoma might have an inhibitory effect on the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and MAP kinase, similar to PR-39.	3
These studies (as well as our invasion studies shown in Figure S1E in Additional file ) indicate that the anti-proliferate response to ETP-45658 (and PI-103) is Forkhead box O dependent and independent of p53.Figure 4 Genes regulated by Forkhead box O transcription factor and validation of key differentially regulated genes.

The significance of this pathway has been confirmed by the significant defects in mast cell activation that follows genetic disruption of genes encoding these molecules ( , , , ).	1
In support of this notion, phosphorylation of T220/T179//T179 was shown to be downregulated in rictor knockdown PC3 cells ( ) and this reduction of pT220/pT179 appeared more evident in MEFs (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) that were derived from rictor null mice ( ) .	1
Moreover, it has been previously shown that CD24-/CD44+ stem like cells can be generated from CD24+/CD44- cells after activation of the oncogenic Ras pathway (Morel et al., ).	2
As shown in ,b and , we observed that significant increase in the phosphorylation of STAT1 (Tyr701 and Ser727) were observed in the TAK165 and all-trans retinoic acid combination treatment group compared with the all-trans retinoic acid or TAK165 single treatment groups, indicating that STAT1 was activated upon the combination treatment-induced differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells.	1

Previous studies have shown that expression of oncogenic Ras in breast cancer cells generates CD24- cells from CD24+ cells.	1
These results therefore argue that uPAR signals through αvβ3 for Rac activation, but that uPAR signaling through β1 integrins can provide an ERK signal for surface localization of αvβ3.	2
A possible explanation for this observation is that underlying TDRG1 upregulation in the seminoma already exerted positive effects on cell proliferation.	2
However, our results cannot exclude the existence of other as yet unidentified ubiquitin ligases excluded by HER2 that may contribute to receptor resistance to ligand-induced degradation.	2
Together, these data show that in mesenchymal cell types the TGF-β/phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase/Pak2/Raf/MEK/Erk pathway regulates smad signaling, is critical for TGF-β-induced growth and is part of an integrated signaling web containing multiple interacting pathways rather than discrete smad/non-smad pathways.	1

We show here that ASPP1 and ASPP2 bind active RAS via their N-termini.	1
As S6 phosphorylation and Rb phosphorylation have been used recently to stratify patients who could benefit from combination of BYL719 with mTOR or CDK4/6 inhibitors, our data suggest that the level of expression and the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 and IRS2 would be an excellent biomarker for the combination of p110α/IGF1R or p110α/p110β inhibitors.	3
Moreover, NDRG2-deficient mice show high levels of AKT phosphorylation in various tissues and spontaneous tumour development of various types, including T-cell lymphomas, providing the first in vivo evidence that NDRG2 functions as a tumour suppressor gene.	1

All these findings demonstrate that ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways are involved in the BMP9 mediated inhibition of proliferation and invasion of SK-BR-3 cells.	1
The difference between rictor knockdown and rictor null cells could be due to the incomplete removal of rictor in the former as we have shown that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2-dependent phosphorylation of T220/179 is highly sensitive to any trace amount of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 activity ( vs ).	3
We did not obtain any signal of the correct molecular mass in these fractions using anti-MO25β antibody (not shown), consistent with previous observations that MO25β is not expressed in mouse liver [ ].	1

Inhibition of caspase 9, caspase 3 and pan-caspase activities blocked the apoptosis induced by silencing of p53-R273H, whereas inhibition of caspase 8 activity did not rescue the cells from undergoing apoptosis, suggesting that the induction of apoptosis following p53-R273H depletion required caspase 9 and caspase 3, but not caspase 8 activity ( ).	2
We found that overexpression of Gab2 enhanced colorectal cancer cell migration and invasive properties.	1
Consistent with these cadherin expression patterns, we found that the cadherin-associated signaling protein β-catenin was membrane localized in MCF-7 vector and MCF-7 CXCR4WT cells but was largely cytoplasmic in MCF-7 CXCR4ΔCTD cells (Supplemental Figure S1c).	1
Reprobing with anti-c-Cbl antibody showed that the amount of c-Cbl was comparable in all lanes.	1
By quantifying relative fluorescence levels in the plasma membrane versus the cytoplasm at various time points after stimulation, we found that membrane recruitment of the Bam32 pleckstrin homology domain was evident within 1 min of B cell antigen receptor stimulation, peaks at ∼5 min, and then slowly declines back to basal levels.	1
Since TGF-β treatment of either Pak2-knockout or dnPak2 transfected cells caused a dramatic reduction, but not a complete block, of c-Raf or Erk phosphorylation or thymidine incorporation, this suggests that Ras may still be involved, but play a minor role.	2
We reported previously that mast cells deficient in linker for activation of T cells demonstrated impaired ERK and JNK activation ( ).	1
From works in T cells as well as mast cells, it is known that the linker for activation of T cells-binding proteins include but are not limited to the additional adapters, Grb-2 and Gads ( - ).	1

Taken together, these data confirm that the rapamycin-inhibited mTOR/FRAP→p53S15P pathway selectively controls apoptosis of syncytia in human primary CD4+ lymphocytes infected by human immunodeficiency virus-1.	1
Although the LKB1 polypeptide was overexpressed to a large extent in the HeLa cells compared to the endogenous levels observed in 293 cells (compare lane 1 with lane 5 or 7), it is clear that the availability of STRADα and/or mouse protein 25-α limits the activity in these cells.	1
In the present study, we found that a submicromolar concentration of As2O3 significantly and dose-dependently decreased phosphorylation of Akt protein and its downstream targets, mTOR and p70s6k, during myogenic differentiation.	1
The full-length Bam32 fusion and the pleckstrin homology domain fusion show similar levels of basal and induced membrane association, indicating that the pleckstrin homology domain is both necessary and sufficient for membrane recruitment.	1

Our data suggest that 14-3-3 proteins bind to Chibby and sequester it in the cytoplasm.	2
More importantly, the phosphorylation levels of phosphoinositide-3 kinase/p85, phosphoinositide-3 kinase/p110, and Akt as well as the phosphorylation sites of mTOR at Ser2448, Ser2481, and Thr2446 provide powerful evidences that TDRG1 is primarily related to seminoma development via the phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.	1
Other studies have reported that B56γ1 is localized in focal contacts together with paxillin and also in the Golgi complex .	1
However, considering the similar phenotype (Figure C), the conserved anti-proliferative effect and the profound effect on global gene expression after phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibition upon exposure to ETP-45658, we directed our attention towards the key genes that displayed a conserved expression after treatment between ETP-45658 and the reference compound PI-103.Figure 1 Cellular response to ETP-45658. (A) Proliferation assay for each indicated cell line treated with serial dilutions of ETP-45658 or reference compound PI-103.	1

Taken together, the data demonstrates that c-Cbl activity negatively regulates VEGF-dependent angiogenic signaling by targeting PLCγ1.	1
More recently it has been shown that the Skp2-mediated degradation of p27 occurs predominantly during the S phase in accord with the fact that it requires the activity of the CDK-containing complexes and a direct phosphorylation on multiple tyrosine residues - .	1
TDRG1 serves as a key modulator that not only promotes seminoma cell proliferation and growth but also confers an aggressive seminoma phenotype by facilitating adhesion and invasion to other tissues.	1
Furthermore, we observed that P-REX1 activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT and MEK/ERK signaling in PTEN-null cells (MDA-MB-415 and ZR75-1; , ).	1

We show that uPAR cooperates with integrin complexes containing β3 integrin to drive formation of the p130Cas-CrkII signaling complex and activation of Rac, resulting in a Rac-driven elongated-mesenchymal morphology, cell motility, and invasion.	1
SiRNA-mediated depletion of SYNJ2 was accomplished using a 3' UTR-targeting oligo that effectively depletes endogenous SYNJ2 (by approximately 90%), but does not target the respective reconstituted proteins.	1
In contrast, it is undetectable in bone marrow and fetal liver, strongly suggesting that expression of T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule is restricted to the T cell compartment.	2
Results represent the mean ± SEM [(A)-(D) n = 3; (E) n = 6; values without a common letter are significantly different, P<0.05). Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test. Several lines of evidence indicate that FGF2 plays an important role in the invasive properties of human cancer cells , . Thus, we examined the effect of FGF2 on cell invasion in ovarian cancer cells using Matrigel-coated Transwell invasion assays. OVCAR-4 and SKOV-3 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of FGF2, resulted in a dose-dependent stimulation of invasion ( ). The involvement of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt/mTOR and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways in FGF2-stimulated cell invasion were also evaluated. Our results showed that FGF2-induced cell invasion was markedly diminished, but not totally, by treatment with wortmannin, rapamycin or U0126 alone ( ), while combined inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt/mTOR and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways totally abolished FGF2-induced cell invasion ( ). Taken together, these results indicate that the MAPK/ERK and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt/mTOR pathways are involved in FGF2-induced ovarian cancer cell invasion. (A) Ovarian cancer cells were seeded in Matrigel-coated transwell inserts and treated with different doses of FGF2 for 24 h. (B) Cells were pre-treated with wortmannin (1 µM), rapamycin (20 nM) or U0126 (10 µM) for 30 min and seeded in Matrigel-coated transwell inserts and cultured with 10 ng/ml FGF2 for 24 h. Results represent the mean ± SEM [(A) n = 3; (B) n = 6; values without a common letter are significantly different, P<0.05]. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test. Next, we asked whether down-regulation of E-cadherin mediated the FGF2-induced cell invasion. SKOV-3 cells were transiently transfected with wild-type human E-cadherin expression plasmid for 48 h and then were treated with FGF2 for further 24 h ( ). FGF2 treatment reduced E-cadherin protein levels in cells transfected with empty vector, whereas no effect was detected in cells overexpressing E-cadherin ( ).	1
Several lines of evidence suggest that integrin activation of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways require FAK ( ; ; ; ).	2
These results imply that complementing HER2-targeted therapies with anti-EGFR drugs may be beneficial in HER2-positive breast cancer.	2
Downregulation of Ras mRNAs in SAF-1 silenced cells further showed the range of downstream networks that can be affected during aberrant silencing or overexpression of a transcription factor.	2
Thus, it is possible that such cleavages may result in the exposition of a small aminoacid and then in a more rapid degradation of p27 protein.	2
While these pro-apoptotic genes were not significantly induced, there was robust Forkhead box O protein recruitment for each gene that we examined by Chromatin immunoprecipitation, indicating that this transcriptional response is regulated post-Forkhead box O DNA recruitment.	1
These findings suggest that the mechanism for F395C interference with wild type function is not dominant negative in the classical sense but due more to competitive binding to other molecules.	2
In a previous paper ( ), we showed that linker for activation of T cells-deficient mast cells failed to release histamine under these conditions.	1
We searched for mutations in exons or splice sites in the genes MEK1, MEK2, A-Raf, B-Raf, C-Raf, EGFR, FGFR, IGFR1, K-Ras, H-Ras and N-Ras in all cell lines used, employing a previously published method [ ] but could not identify mutations that may explain high constitutive ERK phosphorylation in MOS or U2OS (data not shown).	2
These highly sensitive measurements of living ECs are consistent with the model of EC barrier regulation via increased tethering forces generated during enhancement of peripheral actomyosin cytoskeleton and cell-cell junctions ( ) and demonstrate that c-Abl expression-as we have previously demonstrated for cortactin expression ( )-is necessary for the structural changes that occur in association with EC barrier enhancement.	1
We have shown that the kinase helix kα12 constitutes a lipid-binding site.	1
A model that integrates translocation of KRas and Ras/MAPK signaling at a glutamatergic synapse is shown in c.	1

Using either of two MEK1/2 inhibitors with distinct mechanisms for suppression of target activity [ , ], we demonstrated that perturbing the MAP kinase pathway reverts the Rab-coupling protein/α5β1/EGFR1-driven rapid, random migration in 2D to a slower, more persistent, lamellipodial phenotype previously associated with dominant Rab4-αvβ3 integrin recycling [ ].	1
Thus, the physiological significance of RLIP76 mediated transport of endogenously generated GS-Es is further indicated by these results showing that RLIP76 enriched cells are resistant to radiation toxicity.	1

In this study, results showed that BMP9 down-regulated the HER2 protein expression and phosphorylation while both of them were significantly elevated in SK-BR-3 cells when BMP9 expression was silenced In addition, a significant down-regulation of HER2 mRNA expression was observed in BMP9 over-expression group while a dramatic up-regulation of HER2 mRNA expression in BMP9 silencing group.	1
Our data are consistent with a role for MED23 in post-recruitment events that may include conformational changes to Mediator induced by phosphorylation of MED14.	2
Cells with PTEN alterations (n = 7, indicated in red in ) were distributed across the range of sensitivities, implying that PTEN alterations do not correlate with sensitivity.	1
The interaction of SYNJ2 with Src family kinases suggested to us that Src may be phosphorylating SYNJ2 and thereby modulating its activity.	2
Restoration of Rac activity by Tiam1 in RasV12- and RafCAAX-transformed MDCK cells resulted in strong downregulation of Rho activity ( a), a phenomenon that we also observed in Tiam1- and RacV12-expressing NIH3T3 fibroblasts ( ).	1
AMPK activity was determined in immunoprecipitates, and results are means±S.D. (n=3). (B) Samples from the experiment in (A) were analysed in duplicate by Western blotting using antibodies as described in (C). (C) ADP/ATP ratios in an experiment identical with that shown in (A).	1

Previous studies demonstrated Akt could regulate the activation of GSK-3β, p70S6K1 and mTOR, and all of them were able to activate Rac1 , , , , suggesting that hypoxia stimulates Rac1 activation in breast cancer cells by activating phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt signaling.	1
Finally, we obtained essentially identical results in both MCF7 and ECC-1 cell lines under serum-starved or charcoal-stripped serum conditions suggesting that differences in the cell lines' ability to go through cell cycle does not impact this phenomenon.	2
We also demonstrated that PRL-3 was not tyrosine phosphorylated in SYF mouse embryo fibroblasts deficient in Src, Yes and Fyn unless Src was re-expressed.	1
However, we found that these proteins appeared to have the same level of tyrosine phosphorylation in U87MG cells regardless of PTEN expression ( ).	1
In addition, we found that p65-nuclear factor-κB-associated glucocorticoid receptor was deacetylated ( ).	1
While rapamycin showed no obvious effects on both Smad2 activation and T220/T179 phosphorylation ( ), Torin treatment mimicked that of LY in prolonging Smad2 activation and inhibiting T220/T179 phosphorylation ( ), thereby suggesting that mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2, rather than mTORC1, is involved in the regulation of Smad2/3 activity.	2
Our data suggested that pp29/30 preferentially associates with the TCR-CD3-ζ complex.	2
Since the P-REX1 homologue P-REX2a was found to bind PTEN [ ], we considered that PTEN may bind and stabilize P-REX1.	2
It has been shown that the binding of phosphoproteins to the SH2 domains of phosphoinositide 3-kinase p85 activates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase p85/p110 dimers by inducing a transition from an inhibited to a disinhibited state .	1
As proteomic analysis revealed an inverse correlation between activity of the PI3K/mTOR pathway and response to talazoparib in vitro [ ], we hypothesized that the addition of PI3K/mTOR inhibition might further sensitize Small cell lung cancer to PARP inhibitors.	3
Rac1 and RhoA are thought to be mutually antagonistic [ , ], and studies suggest that cyclic bursts of RhoA and Rac1 activity in a pseudo-oscillatory manner may drive the leading edge of some cells forward by producing a necessary push-pull mechanism [ , ].	2
Similar results were also obtained in MKN-45/CDDP cells ( B). (C) and (D) show that PF-3758309 (1.3 nM) treatment could significantly suppress MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt signalling at the indicated time points in AGS/CDDP and MKN-45/CDDP cells, respectively.	3
They also reported that BRSK1 could be phosphorylated (at Thr189, equivalent to Thr172 on AMPK-α1) and activated by both CaMKKα and CaMKKβ, although the rate of phosphorylation was much lower with CaMKKβ than CaMKKα.	3
In the NetworKIN analysis, we showed that the involvement of basal kinases including CAMKII, PKA, AKT/PKB, PKC, PAK, and p70S6K was significantly increased in H1299 cells relative to A549 and H322 cells ( ).	1

We observe global conformational changes that might be of relevance to allosteric regulation of p110α, and provide a structural context to understand the functional data presented here.	3
DNA-dependent protein kinase, ATM, ATR, as well as the downstream DNA-damage-induced kinases Chk1 (activated by UV) and Chk2 (activated by ionizing radiation), phosphorylate serine residues within the NH2 terminus of p53, a modification that by itself may increase its transactivating function and/or inhibits the interaction of p53 with MDM2 and so prevents degradation of the p53 protein, which accumulates and can act as a transcription factor, stimulating the expression of several membrane permeabilization-inducing proteins including Bax .	2
We show that phosphorylation of tyrosines 295//Y295 and 361 of Dok1 by Abl family kinases suppresses CrkI transforming activity, and that upon phosphorylation these tyrosines bind the SH2 domains of the Ras inhibitor p120 RasGAP.	1
In a recent report, indicated that sodium arsenite triggered the increment or decrement of p53 binding to DNA to affect proliferation or differentiation in epithelial cells through an Akt-related signaling pathway.	1
To the contrary, treatment of fibroblast with TGF-β, in the absence or presence of active Erk ( ), demonstrated that linker region phosphorylation (TGF-β alone) resulted in sustained levels of smad 2 and 3 (C-terminal phosphorylated), suggesting that linker phosphorylation is associated with an increased stability of C-terminal phospho-smads 2 and 3.	1
Anderson et al. [ ] recently provided evidence suggesting that CaMKKβ (also known as CaMKK2) can form a stable complex with the AMPK α and β subunits.	2
By studying phosphorylation in cell-free assays and in cells lacking LKB1, including LKB1-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts and HeLa cells, it was shown that at least 12 of these were also dependent on LKB1 for basal phosphorylation of the threonine residue equivalent to Thr172, and hence for basal activity.	1
In the present study we demonstrate that a small region of B56γ (aa391-401) is critical for interaction with the tumor suppressor protein p53.	1
We show that inhibition of Shp2 activity is likely to result from the inability of Shp2 to bind to the receptor in the presence of the Grb2-FGFR2 complex.	1
Collectively, our results show that HDAC2 is a key protein involved in the suppression of p65-nuclear factor-κB-mediated inflammatory gene expression, which occurs at low concentrations of dexamethasone, whereas modulation of HDAC2 expression does not reduce glucocorticoid receptor-mediated gene induction.	1
A demonstrates that under these experimental conditions, pp29/30 exclusively coprecipitates with the CD3-ε molecule but not with the CD2, CD4, CD8, and CD28 coreceptors and also not with the CD45 and HLA class I molecules.	1
PP2A is known to be inhibited by mTOR/FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein , suggesting that its late (36 h) downregulation may be secondary to the upregulation/activation of mTOR/FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein detectable at 18 h. 	2
These results suggest that TAS-116 potently overcomes the resistance mechanism induced by rat sarcoma mutations.	2
We found that treatment with both LY294002 and sorafenib did not increase CD24 mRNA expression (Figures ).	1
These results suggest that Gab2 is critical for the acquisition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition characteristics and may contribute to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-induced invasive phenotype in colorectal cancer cells.Fig. 4Gab2 regulates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in colorectal cancer cells. a Morphological changes by Gab2 in SW480 and SW620 cells. b, c and d Western blot and Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR show downregulated expression of E-cadherin and upregulated expression of vimentin in SW480-Gab2 cells.	2
The results of three independent experiments showed in obtained by comparing the protein expression (in arbitrary units) with the fentomoles of p27 mRNA present in each transfectant, demonstrated that when the threonine 198//T198 in p27 was mutated in G or A only 1/10 of the protein was found per each fentomole of mRNA as compared with the ratio observed for the WT protein ( ).	1
We performed mass spectrometry analysis of TAP-tagged Tiam1 purified from mitotically arrested DLD1 cells and found that S1466 was phosphorylated ( ).	1
We have demonstrated that CD24 expression is directly suppressed by oncogenic Ras, however, while inhibition of the MEK was sufficient to partially restore CD24 expression at the mRNA level, inhibition of Raf was necessary to increase CD24+ cells.	1
The data in and therefore suggest that CARP-1 functional mimetics are novel inhibitors of Medulloblastoma cell growth, and although the Medulloblastoma cells display varying levels of sensitivity towards these compounds, all the three CARP-1 functional mimetics significantly attenuate Medulloblastoma cell growth in part by stimulating apoptosis.	2
Additionally, phosphorylation of Ser-189//S189 may disrupt interactions that link the N and C SH2 domains to reduce cooperative binding of phosphotyrosine ligands to the two SH2 domains.	2
Here we demonstrate that sphingosine 1-phosphate stimulation strongly increases tyrosine phosphorylation of both critical barrier-regulatory proteins in a c-Abl-dependent manner as c-Abl silencing markedly attenuated these key posttranslational signaling events as measured by quantification of immunofluorescent intensity from multiple independent experiments ( ).	1
P-REX1 expression was highest in ER+ breast tumors compared to many other cancer subtypes, suggesting that neutralizing the P-REX1/Rac axis may provide a novel therapeutic approach to selectively abrogate oncogenic signaling in breast cancer cells.	2
Unlike β-catenin and plakoglobin, p120 does not bind α-catenin or the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli , indicating that its role is fundamentally different from that of the other catenins ( ).	1
This protection against renal injury in vivo resulted from reduced infiltration of leukocytes, diminished expression of cytokines which are known to promote renal injury, and reduced production of Ig, leading to the conclusion that activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase is required to promote cytokine/chemokine and Ig production, which in turn result in lethal autoimmune renal injury in vivo.	1
MEF2C is a transcription factor that is well known to be phosphorylated and activated by ERK5 [ ].	1
In this context, our previous finding that Abl downregulation enhanced transformation by Crk ( ) was both surprising and potentially disturbing, as it raised the possibility that Abl inhibitors could promote instead of inhibit tumor growth in some situations.	3
We have previously demonstrated that nmMLCK inhibits Arp2/3-catalzyed actin polymerization through its interaction with cortactin ( ), an actin-binding protein which accelerates actin polymerization.	1
This led us to hypothesise that this could be the result of differential Forkhead box O-promoter binding.	3
As shown in and , we found that the relative phosphortlation of STAT1 (Tyr701 and Ser727) increased significantly in all-trans retinoic acid and TAK165 combination group.	1
These data therefore collectively suggest that Medulloblastoma cell growth inhibition by CARP-1 functional mimetic-4 is regulated in part by NTF3-dependent signaling mechanisms. (A-C) CARP-1 functional mimetic treatments result in elevated NTF3 levels in Medulloblastoma cells.	2
Kymography indicated that the changes in lamellipodial formation and cell spreading may result from poor stability of these structures - HUVEC that expressed Rac1-Y64D repeatedly extended lamellipodia, but these structures could not support cell spreading because they were not persistent ( ) (see also ).	2
We previously demonstrated that cellular adhesion in response to EphB1 stimulation follows a biphasic curve, depending on the surface density of encountered ephrinB1 ( ).	1
It has been shown that cells devoid of Shp2 show an increase in phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase activity, as well as elevated and sustained levels of Akt activation in response to EGF treatment [ ].	1
We had previously shown under nonstimulated conditions that unlike FGFR1, FGFR2 does not form a complex with FRS2 ( ).	1
Here, we show that increased phospholipase D activity combined with constitutive CRAF activation failed to recapitulate FAM83B-mediated transformation.	1
Importantly, HDAC2 knockdown does not inhibit glucocorticoid receptor-glucocorticoid response element binding or SLPI transactivation ( ), indicating that the acetylated glucocorticoid receptor is still able to activate glucocorticoid-responsive genes, which may be involved in some of the deleterious side effects that limit the clinical use of these powerful drugs, as well as some minor antiinflammatory effects via induction of antiinflammatory molecules such as SLPI and MKP-1.	2
First, expression of the Bax protein increases ( B), as does that of Bax mRNA (data not shown).	1
It has been shown that ERK5 and ERK2 form homodimers/oligomers.	1

Based on these results, we postulated that SMYD3 might have a role in Ras-driven tumorigenesis.	3
Simultaneous mutation of both 88S//S88 and 100T//T100 inhibited RhoA phosphorylation more strongly than the single mutation of either 88S or 100T, except for the mutation of 100T to 100E that inhibited RhoA phosphorylation to the same degree as the double mutation of both 88S and 100T to E.	1
Further, we show that both Pak1 and Pak2 counteract centrosome separation in a kinase-dependent manner and demonstrate that they act downstream of Tiam1.	1
Here, we showed that silencing of endogenous p53-R273H contact mutant, but not p53-R175H conformational mutant, reduced AKT phosphorylation, induced BCL2-modifying factor expression, sensitized BIM dissociation from BCL-XL and induced mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in cancer cells.	1
Conversely, under our conditions of analysis, the efficient competition of the SH3 domains of Grb2 and E3b1 for binding to the same Sos-1 peptide, coupled to the readily detectable biological competition, strongly suggests that the SH3-mediated contact is the major determinant of the interaction between Sos-1 and E3b1.	2
The non-interacting QC mutant showed similar results to the F395C mutant, while those mutants that retained p53 interaction also retained similar p53-dependent functions comparable to wild type B56γ3 ( ).	1
These results suggest that phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and ERK act as the upstream effector of Rac1 activation.	2
Consistent with the restricted tissue distribution pattern, reverse transcription-PCR analyses indicated that Bam32 is expressed in all B cell lines examined, but not in T cell, epithelial cell, fibroblast, or myelocytic leukemia lines ( B).	1
That Ser491//S491 is modified instead by autophosphorylation is shown by the following findings: (i) substantial phosphorylation of Ser491//S491 occurred with the recombinant human α2β2γ1 complex in the absence of exogenous kinases ( A and B); (ii) Ser491 phosphorylation did not occur with an inactive (D157A mutant) complex ( B); (iii) various forms of AMPK, including the human α2β2γ1 complex, phosphorylated a synthetic peptide corresponding to the sequence around Ser491, but not Ser485 on rat α1 ( D); and (iv) Ser491 on AMPK-α2 became phosphorylated in response to the AMPK activator berberine in HEK-293 cells, whereas Ser487 on AMPK-α1 did not ( C).	1
These results show that HRAS mutant cell lines are addicted to continuous HRAS activity which is required for survival.	1

This analysis showed that the level of pTpYERK at 15 min under the EGF+COL condition was significantly higher than that under the EGF-only condition.	1

The results show that danusertib inhibited activation of Akt at Ser473 without a significant change in expression of total Akt in either cell line ( ).	1
Silencing the expression of IQGAP1 in primary endothelial cells, but not control siRNA, significantly inhibited VEGF-dependent cell proliferation ( ), suggesting that VEGFR-2/c-Src orchestrated tyrosine phosphorylation of IQGAP1 serves an important role in endothelial cell proliferation.	2
We examined biomarkers that were associated with sensitivity to both BKM-120 and the talazoparib + BKM-120 combination to identify potential markers of response that could eventually be applied to patient selection.	3
We have reported previously that Rac1T108 is phosphorylated by activated ERK [ ].	1

Recent studies also suggest that KLF5 could regulate angiogenesis.	3
It has been reported that MKP3 is induced by Erk1/2 upon fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) stimulation in NIH3T3 cells , suggesting that growth factor-induced Erk1/2 activity could be controlled by negative feedback loops via Erk1/2-specific MKP3 expression.	3
We found that Src phosphorylates SYNJ2 on Tyr490, thereby stimulating SYNJ2 5'-phosphatase activity in vitro.	1
These intriguing findings suggest that the interactions of these three proteins, c-Abl, cortactin, and nmMLCK, may regulate the capacity for cortactin to cross-link and stabilize the cortical actin meshwork against depolymerization ( ).	2
Fujimoto et al. [ ] recently reported a search for proteins from rat brain extracts that interacted with the kinase domain of CaMKKα, and detected both the α1 subunit of AMPK and BRSK1 (SAD-B).	1
Our data point to RAC1 and CDC42 as drivers of such a basal, p110β-controlled activity, an idea consistent with a previous report finding that ectopic expression of wild-type but not RAS-binding domain mutant p110β is sufficient to transform chicken embryo fibroblasts ( ).	2
Although gefitinib treatment and small interfering RNA experiments suggest that cells expressing mutant EGFR are dependent on EGFR function for survival [ , , ], the direct transforming potential of the mutations observed in lung adenocarcinoma has not been described.	2
We previously reported that SMYD3 methylates histone H4 at lysine 5 (H4K5) and not at other lysines on histones .	1
The bottom panel shows that upon LY294002 addition there was substantial decrease in AKT Ser473-phosphorylation, suggesting that LY294002 is functional.	2
We also showed that phosphorylation of RhoA by ERK increased its activity and its function in mediating stress fiber formation.	1
The findings of our present study show that danusertib significantly increases the expression of E-cadherin but decreases the expression of N-cadherin.	1
All these demonstrate that ASPP2 is a novel substrate of mitogen-activated protein kinase and Ser827 of ASPP2 can be phosphorylated by RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.	1
Previous studies show that STAT1 is phosphorylated by MAPK cascades, including MEK, ERK, p38 and JNK .	1
Here, we provide evidence that nuclear-targeted Akt inhibits, whereas membrane-tethered Akt stimulates, β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation ( ).	1
It is known that overexpression of HER2 in breast cancer patients lead to aberrant signaling of the MEK/ERK pathway. , Lapatinib, a selective small-molecule inhibitor of EGFR and HER2 tyrosine kinases, quickly disables EGFR and HER2 signaling, resulting in the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways.	1
Considering the functional diversity that TGF-βs display, these pathway(s) have the potential to play a major role either as direct alternative signaling pathways or in crosstalk with smads, to generate the multitude of observed TGF-β effects.	1
Then we interrupted the pathways that we found were activated by using both dominant-negative and inhibitor approaches.	1
Interestingly, unlike β-catenin, plakoglobin was expressed at moderate levels even in the absence of E-cadherin ( C, plakoglobin, lanes 2 and 3) and was not affected by ectopically expressed E-cadherin, indicating that its stability in these cells is regulated differently from that of β-catenin.	1
We thus show that SHP2 is a direct activator of Ras and a potential therapeutic target for cancers driven by a previously 'undruggable' oncogenic or hyperactive Ras.	1
B, top right, demonstrates that p85 coprecipitates with the wild-type chimera but not with the T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule chimera in which tyrosines 63, 79, and 110 were mutated to phenylalanine.	1
Further, we generated GST-Ack construct that harbors kinase, SH3 and CRIB domain (schematic shown in ) and expressed it in E. coli ( ) , .	1
It has been suggested that B-Raf inhibition in Ras-mutant cells causes c-Raf-dependent MEK/ERK activation .	2
All these suggest that N-termini of ASPP1 and ASPP2 selectively bind active RAS.	2
Replacing wild-type Shp2 with the Y542F (red line) or C459S (green line) mutant results in no immediate reduction in lifetime, confirming that the FGFR2-Grb2 complex is not rescued by adding these compromised phosphatases. (C) Measurement of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between GFP-FGFR2cyto (Cyto) and RFP-Grb2 in solution using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy.	1
We further showed that RhoA phosphorylation on 88S and 100T increase ROCK1 activity and the phosphorylation of ROCK1 substrate NYPT1 ( ).	1
The results so far described demonstrate that HER2 alters autophosphorylation patterns to confer resistance to ligand-induced degradation and to ultimately enhance cooperative signaling and transformational capacity.	1
However, these effects were dependent on ERK1/2 as well, suggesting that both the ERK5 and ERK1/2 signaling cascades are necessary and that cross-talk between these pathways may occur.	2
We confirmed that treatment of these cancer cell lines with 5-aza-deoxycytidine resulted in an increased abundance of NDRG2 mRNA ( ).	1
This result shows that Shp2 can dephosphorylate the C-terminal SH3 domain domain of Grb2 and is specific for pY209.	2
We conclude that inhibition of the PI3K pathway is not relevant for survival and cell growth of HRAS mutant cancer cells.	1
These data suggest that in rabbit synovial fibroblasts expressing FRNK, Cas is required for transmission of matrix survival signals from fibronectin via interaction with the Proline-rich region 1 of FAK/FRNK.	2
Here we investigated Medulloblastoma growth inhibitory potential of the CARP-1 functional mimetics and found that CARP-1 functional mimetic-4 inhibits growth of Medulloblastoma cells in part by inducing CARP-1 expression, promoting PARP cleavage, activating pro-apoptotic stress-activated protein kinases p38 and JNK, and apoptosis.	1
The reason that P-REX1 levels did not increase as markedly in shPTEN cells compared to shMM cells upon phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibition is unclear but may be due in part to residual PIP3 in shPTEN cells, as evidenced by residual p-AKT in BKM-120-treated T47D/shPTEN cells ( ).	2
It should be noted that, as demonstrated previously, linker for activation of T cells-/- Bone marrow-derived mast cells show a modest calcium response.	1
Alternatively, it is possible that CSF-1R-induced changes in cellular adhesion could alter the localization of SRC modifying its access to specific substrates and thus leading to distinct patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation dependent on the Y561 site.	3
Earlier studies have demonstrated that the CSF-1R Y561F mutation impairs the ligand-dependent auto-phosphorylation of CSF-1R; however, the Y561F mutation did not compromise the auto-phosphorylation of constitutively active variant of CSF-1R in this analysis as both the activation loop residue, Y809, and Y873 had equal levels of tyrosine phosphorylation between constitutively active variant of CSF-1R and constitutively active variant of CSF-1R Y561F , .	1
Therefore, we hypothesize that alteration of skeletal myogenic differentiation may be involved in low birth weight after exposure to arsenic and that arsenic may also alter muscle regeneration.	2
These results suggest that mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation of ASPP2 Ser827 is necessary for Raf CAAX to stimulate the full transcriptional activity of p53 via ASPP2. (A) Saos2 cells were transfected with p53 and either wild-type or mutant ASPP2 as indicated together with a Bax-luciferase reporter.	2

In this study, our results that inhibition of PAK4 leads to suppression of PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways suggest that PAK4 overexpression may contribute to such constitutive activation.	2
Taken as a whole, these in vitro and in vivo findings suggest that As2O3 may be an environmental risk factor for myogenesis.	2
In our previous studies, we found that the protein phosphatase activity of PTEN appeared to contribute to a block on the epithelial to mesenchymal transition that these cells undergo before they exit the primitive streak, whereas the lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN had no effect on this epithelial to mesenchymal transition, but interfered with the directed nature of the subsequent migration of these cells through the embryo ( ).	1
Unexpectedly, these data showed that PP2A-B56γ1 activity dramatically decreased within 1 min of stimulation, to the point where no activity could be detected ( ).	3
Importantly, evidence has shown that 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin represses estrogen receptor target gene activation through the AHR/ARNT complex.	1
It could be speculated that NDRG2 expression is induced by hypoxia-ischemia in the brain to regulate PTEN phosphorylation, leading to the suppression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT activation and induction of apoptosis.	3
Hence, it is tempting to speculate that the constitutive activation of PI3K/AKT by p53-R273H may be partly modulated by one or a combination of these mechanisms.	2
Given the association of SHP2 expression with the receptor tyrosine kinase-driven 'classical' subgroup of Glioblastoma multiforme and the identification of potential activating mutations in Glioblastoma multiforme samples, it is not surprising that knockdown of SHP2 with SHP2-targeting siRNA resulted in a loss of cell viability.	1
To confirm that p130Cas and Crk are required for uPAR signaling to Rac activation, we used the ectopic uPAR expression system.	1
In addition, we found that serine 111//S111 phosphorylation may precede serine 112//S112 phosphorylation to facilitate serine 112//S112 phosphorylation.	2
We have shown that ERK is recruited to the promoters of immediate early genes by Elk-1 and inferred that ERK may phosphorylate additional substrates in pre-initiation complexes assembled on immediate early gene promoters ( ).	2
Interestingly, ErbB3 reproducibly shows constitutive low-level tyrosine phosphorylation that is augmented only 1.3-fold in response to EGF treatment.	1
Collectively, these data demonstrate that the Chibby serine 20 residue within the mode II 14-3-3-binding motif mediates the interaction with 14-3-3 proteins.	1
Our findings demonstrate that loss of c-Cbl in mouse is associated with increased VEGF, tumor and laser-induced angiogenesis.	1
Together, these results suggest that Bam32 expression is specifically increased during T cell-dependent activation, is maintained at high levels during the subsequent germinal center response, and then decreases upon differentiation to memory B cells.	2
We also semi-quantitated the western blot results of STAT1, similar changes were observed ( ), suggesting that the STAT1 up-regulation was not universal phenomena after all-trans retinoic acid and TAK165 combination treatment in acute myeloid leukemia cells.	2
In conclusion, we demonstrated that p53-R273H contact mutant suppresses BCL2-modifying factor expression in a way that is dependent on PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to promote cancer cell survival and anoikis resistance.	1
As a positive control, we used HPB-ALL cells that were first lysed in Digitonin-containing buffer and then subjected to CD3 immunoprecipitation, whereas the Jurkat variant JRT3-T3.1, which is deficient in expression of the T Cell Receptor α chain and therefore does not express a CD3 complex on the cell surface (but expresses identical amounts of CD3-ε as wild-type Jurkat cells intracellularly; data not shown), was used as a negative control.	1
Western bolt assay demonstrated that BMP9 inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, but had no effect on the p38 and JNK expression in SK-BR-3 cells ( ).	1
We demonstrate that Gab2 induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by the MEK/ERK/MMP pathway, which in turn promotes colorectal cancer cells metastasis.	1
B, bottom right, depicts that p85 binds to c_F,mut9.4 but not to c_F,mut12.1.	1
The experiment presented in Fig shows that mutation of the p85 binding sites on Gab1 did not affect recruitment of Shp2 by Gab1 following EGF stimulation (Figure , fourth panel from the top).	1
We found that resveratrol efficiently reversed the PMA-induced MMP-9 secretion and COX-2 expression.	1
Confirming that loss of Rac reduced cell motility, time-lapse phase-contrast microscopy revealed a severe defect in random cell motility when DOCK180 or uPAR was silenced (Videos 1-3 [BE], available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712050/DC1; and not depicted for MDA-MB-231 and SNB19).	1
Since recent data suggested that Pak1 phosphorylated BAD indirectly through Raf-1 , we decided to re-examine if Pak1 could phosphorylate BAD directly.	3
For example, synthetic molecules that influence the control function of Grb2 might provide innovative drug compounds.	3
Our current data do not support Sirt1 requirements in our brain EC model suggesting that cell specificity may dictate resveratrol efficacy in inhibiting MMP-9 in neuroinflammation or brain tumor angiogenesis.	2
Furthermore, we have shown that the protein-tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 (PTPN11) interacts with AKAP-Lbc and demonstrated that AKAP-Lbc integrates PKA and Shp2 signaling in the heart ( ).	1
We have shown that these important protein-protein interactions are altered by nmMLCK phosphorylation and have identified several novel proteins which bind nmMLCK including cortactin ( ), macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( ), and caspase 8 ( ).	1
Our results, thus, provide evidence for another mechanism that tumors may use to promote metastasis, especially in tumors where mutant p53 is highly expressed.	2
In conclusion, we show that overexpression of HDAC2 in glucocorticoid-insensitive alveolar macrophages from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is able to restore glucocorticoid sensitivity.	1
Although we have not determined phosphorylation of the putative c-Cbl and Grb2 docking sites (Y1112 and Y1139, respectively) in HER2 due to lack of specific antibodies, the modest overall autophosphorylation suggests that phosphorylation on these sites may not occur.	2
Here, we report that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signalling antagonizes the Activin-induced definitive endoderm differentiation of human embryonic stem cells by attenuating the duration of Smad2/3 activation via the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 .	1
Others have suggested that cyclic activity of RhoA and Rac1 is important in determining motility [ , ], and our model is also suggestive of this.	2
Because BCL2 family proteins have been shown to have a critical role in mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway, we hypothesize that mutant p53-R273H might mediate the survival of breast cancer cells through regulation of BCL-2 family proteins expression.	3
Similarly, at higher concentration ratios of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/SHP2 in VEGF-stimulated endothelial cells, the lipid kinase is not limiting and AKT is phosphorylated to the same extent regardless of Gab2 knockdown, indicated that sufficient phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is activated for maximal AKT phosphorylation [ ].	1
These results show that ectopic expression of uPAR drives formation of the p130Cas-Crk complex.	1
We showed previously that Orf virus-encoded protein 002 inhibits the acetylation of NF-κB p65.	1
These data suggest that P-REX1 levels are modulated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling at the transcriptional and post-translational levels: PIP3-mediated activation of P-REX1 may induce P-REX1 protein turnover as a form of negative feedback, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibition blocks negative feedback to induce transcription of genes encoding proteins that activate and transduce phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling [e.g., ERBB3, IGF1R [ ], TSC1 [ ], and PREX1].	2
This could be therapeutically relevant, as we have shown that, while exerting antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects, single-agent metformin treatment could enhance pro-proliferating signals through the RAS/RAF/mitogen-activated-protein-kinase pathway, that could in turn induce cell proliferation in those cell lines with constitutively activating RAS mutations.	3
Quantification of red and green fluorescence by image -J analysis confirmed the qualitative fluorescent findings that the RLIP76 depletion by antisense was effective in inducing apoptosis ( ).	1
Thus, while the nature of this study does not allow us to distinguish between direct and indirect SRC substrates, this motif analysis of the Y561-dependent phosphorylation sites suggest that many are in fact direct SRC substrates since the most prominent sequence motif closely matches known c-SRC consensus motifs , .	2
Collectively, these findings suggest that HER2-mediated MEK/ERK regulates the expression of COX-2, which subsequently suppresses the AKT signaling pathway in non-small-cell lung cancer cells.	2
We reported recently that apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 2, an activator of p53, co-operates with oncogenic RAS to enhance the transcription and apoptotic function of p53.	1
Thus, our data suggested that HER2 pathway might not be essential for myeloid differentiation induced by the TAK165 and all-trans retinoic acid combination treatment.	3
Previously, we demonstrated that linker for activation of T cells is essential for optimal tyrosine phosphorylation, activation of phospholipase C-γ1 and phospholipase C-γ2, and, thus, for calcium mobilization ( ).	1
Homology scanning by DNA Star software of the pJNK peptide sequence against the regions surrounding the FAK autophosphorylation site (Y397) or kinase domain (Y576/Y577) was carried out to assess the possibility that the anti-pJNK antibody might cross react with FAK.	3
Differential tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl by VEGFR-2 or VEGFR-2 activated tyrosine kinases suggests that c-Cbl activity is uniquely regulated by this receptor system and it may play a distinct role in the integration of angiogenic signaling of VEGFR-2.	2
We have observed that even when centrioles are far apart in cells they seem to remain connected by a loose structure containing the matrix protein AKAP 450 and centrin (unpublished data).	1
Our studies demonstrated that RICTOR-dependent AKT Ser473 phosphorylation aids β1 integrins in protecting cells from cell death under serum starvation conditions.	1
Significantly, flow cytometry showed that αvβ3 was not expressed at the surface of control or empty vector-transfected human embryonic kidney 293T cells but was expressed at the surface of uPAR-transfected cells ( ).	1
Figure shows that when the AMP-activated protein kinaseα1β1γ1 or AMP-activated protein kinaseα1β1γ1 heterotrimers were used as substrate, the activation of all three AMP-activated protein kinase kinase preparations was stimulated from 2- to 3.5-fold by AMP.	1
Expression of a dominant-negative mutant of SRC (c-SRC K295R) or pharmacological inhibition of SRC kinase activity in the presence of CSF-1R activation preserves cell-cell adhesion, providing additional evidence that SRC activity and phosphorylation of SRC substrates are involved in the disruption observed .	1
The establishment of a protein-protein interactome suggests that downstream phosphorylation targets of oncogenic Ras/MAPK-mediated signaling are closely associated in their molecular function.	2
Similarly, all the γvariants could be plausible to bind to ERK as the present study showed that B56γ1 bound to and phosphorylated ERK.	3
Numerous reports have demonstrated that MKP3 expression is dependent on Erk1/2 activity in several cell types, including NIH3T3, human pancreatic cancer, and non-small-cell lung cancer cells , - .	1
Our results also demonstrate that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-mediated phosphorylation of this residue can occur in the absence of Smad2/3 activation ( ), which raised the question as to whether Nedd4L binds to both active and inactive Smad2/3 or solely to the active form.	1
However, we found that inhibition of PI3K with the inhibitor BKM120 alone or in combination did not block cell growth or further enhanced it (Figure ).	1
If so, PRL-3 expression, which increases with progression in many tumor types, may help identify tumors that will be sensitive to Src inhibitors.	2
We reasoned that this could be due to the low efficiency of the immunoprecipitating antibodies used.	3
The asterisk indicates a soluble protein that is picked up by the anti-GFP antibody and corresponds presumably to a minor fraction of GFP that is not coupled to the prenyl modification.	1
We chose these cell lines harbouring LKB1 wild-type gene since we previously demonstrated that metformin interferes and leads to activation of AMPK by LKB1 in the absence of LKB1 mutation [ ].	1
It has recently been shown that activation of RAS results in ASPP2 translocation from the plasma membrane to the cytosol and nucleus [ ].	1
Previous studies have demonstrated that PI3K/AKT signaling promotes hypoxia inducible factor 1α protein accumulation by either increasing its translation or by inhibiting its degradation or both [ , , ].	1
The data presented here suggest structure-function relationships within the Rac1 Switch II domain that may be altered by tyrosine phosphorylation and change Rac1-mediated cytoskeletal dynamics during cell spreading.	2
Although single knockdowns had only minor effects, combined knockdown of RAC1 and CDC42 significantly lowered phospho-AKT levels in wild-type, but not in p110β-RAS-binding domain-DM cells, closing the gap in steady-state phospho-AKT levels between the genotypes and suggesting that endogenous RAC1 and CDC42 cooperatively activate p110β via its RAS-binding domain.	2
Importantly, because these probes lack the functional protein domains (other than the few amino acids that are part of the targeting motif), observed differences in subcellular localization are expected to be a direct consequence of their membrane-anchoring motif.	2
Phase images are shown of some of the HUVEC transfected with Rac1-WT, and Rac1-64F, and Rac1-64D that were used for the kymography analysis shown in .	1
Our findings indicate that targeting MEK1/2 using specific drugs (such as Selumetinib-AZD6244 and PD184352 used here) may abrogate the harmful invasive migration and metastasis in certain contexts, particular for patients with tumours that harbour gain-of-function p53 mutation or which exhibit an upregulation in α5β1 expression.	2
Further, we show that platelet-derived growth factor can stimulate PRL-3 phosphorylation in a Src-dependent manner.	2
Cells expressing full-length Bam32 containing the R184C or K197E mutations showed similar or slightly increased B cell antigen receptor-induced nuclear factor of activated T cells activation compared with controls ( C), indicating that PI(3,4,5)3-mediated membrane recruitment of Bam32 is required for the inhibitory effect.	1
The results presented in the current report ( ) reveal that maximal transformation and tumorigenesis by HER2 was dependent on EGFR.	1
Cells that did not penetrate the filter were wiped off, and invaded cells on the lower surface of the filter were fixed with ice-cold methanol and stained with 0.5% crystal violet.	1
We found that ERK in nuclei is dephosphorylated only by PP2A-B56γ1.	1
Measuring tumor weight confirmed that blocking EGFR expression in the HER2 cells reduced tumor burden by approximately 3.5 fold ( ).	1
A strong correlation was demonstrated between the ability of a B56γ3 construct to interact with p53, promote p21 induction, and the ability of that construct to block anchorage independent growth in a p53-dependent manner.	1
Crk is known to localize to adhesions by binding to phosphorylated paxillin and p130Cas( - ), and we showed that CrkI was enriched at paxillin-containing adhesions in CrkI-overexpressing cells ( ).	1
Our results provide strong evidence, both in cell-free assays and in intact cells, that complexes between LKB1, STRADα/β and mouse protein 25-α/β constitute the long sought-after upstream kinases that activate AMP-activated protein kinase via phosphorylation at Thr172 in the activation loop.	1
Given that the pERK1/2 and pERK5 signals are reduced in lung adenocarcinoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma samples from Smyd3 mutant mice ( and ; ), we reasoned that SMYD3-mediated methylation of MAP3K2 may regulate signaling within the Ras/ERK pathway.	2
We found that, compared with scrambled siRNA (mock), siRNA against Rac1 effectively reduced Rac1 expression in MCF-7 cells under normoxia ( ).	1
Thus, collectively these data suggest the existence of additional pathways that regulate AKT activation in response to growth factors.	2
However, we have found that the T220/T179//T179 residue can be readily phosphorylated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 signalling in the absence of Smad2/3 activation and is thus independent of AA-induced CDK or Erk activation.	2
In conclusion, our findings strongly suggest that HSP20 directly associates with phosphoinositide 3-kinase and regulates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKT activity in human hepatocellular carcinoma.	2
The mitotic role of Tiam1 may help to explain, at least in part, why the few Ras-induced skin tumours that form in Tiam1-knockout mice more frequently undergo malignant progression , as mis-segregation of chromosomes could increase chromosomal instability , a hallmark of tumourigenesis.	2
These results led us to re-examine the effect of cycloheximide on EGF-induced migration at an early time point, and we found that cycloheximide inhibited EGF-induced cell migration at 1 hour after EGF administration ( ). (A) Kinetics of IER3 protein expression evaluated by western blotting. (B) Kinetics of IER3 protein expression measured by dot blot analysis. (C) The effect of cycloheximide on early migration of Calu1 cells.	1
We found that there was a significant and substantial reduction in the percentage of cells expressing CD24 surface protein in RasV12 and RasV12S35 cells (Figure ).	1
We observed that purified ASPP1 fragment (1-310), containing the RAS-association domains, interacted with purified RAS in vitro.	1
Using immunohistochemistry with a specific antibody, we could show that Shank3 localizes to basolateral cell membranes in epithelial tubules of the developing kidney in E16.5 mouse embryos ( , a and b).	3
This is particularly due to current limitations in microscopy methods: i) wavelength constraints and the availability of suitable FRET pair fluorescent proteins dictate that only either Rac1 or RhoA activity, but not both, can be visualised in any single cell; ii) the channels required for FRET ratio calculations decree that GTPase activity can only be sampled at certain discrete timepoints (every 15 seconds in our experiments) making it difficult to reveal oscillations unless exactly in phase.	2
If the reported inactivation signal from Src was the same signal as the immediate inactivation of PP2A in the present study, it could have originated both from growth factor receptor and integrin, since it has been reported that a growth factor receptor caused PP2A deactivation through Src and Src is involved in integrin-generated signals .	3
This is consistent with a previous study which shows that the loss of TAp63 is less potent in inducing metastasis as compared with mutant p53 expression in a mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, suggesting that mutant p53 does more than inhibiting TAp63.	2
Our data imply that in MED23-/- Murine Embryonic Fibroblasts Elk-1 would not be precluded from pre-initiation complex formation at such promoters but would be unable to stimulate post-recruitment events.	2
We also demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB3 may lead to recruitment and activation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and Akt in Gab1-/- MEFs.	1
When we treated ST88-14 with various kinase inhibitors ( lane 3-6), we found that the Pak inhibition reduced phosphorylation of Bad at serine 111//S111 and serine 112//S112.	1
Others have shown that protein kinase D1 conditional knockout mice are resistant to isoproterenol-dependent hypertrophy ( ).	1
In the current report, we present evidence that show that HER2 overcomes regulatory mechanism by altering autophosphorylation patterns both on itself and the heterodimerized EGFR in a manner that favors downstream signaling and disfavors ligand-induced down regulation.	1
Together with the findings that almost identical levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule as found in wild-type Jurkat cells are inducible in a Jurkat variant lacking expression of both Syk and ZAP70 (P116 cells; Fig. ), and that the recently described src-kinase inhibitor PP1 ( ) completely inhibited T Cell Receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule, our data strongly suggest that T Cell Receptor Interacting Molecule could represent a specific substrate for src-kinases.	3
This finding suggests that F395C may be able to function as a dominant negative mutant by competing with wild type B56γ for binding to the PP2A core, thereby blocking C subunit-substrate interactions.	2
We found that Tiam1 also localizes to mitotic centrosomes, and that its depletion leads to increased intercentrosomal distance in early mitosis, a higher incidence of chromosome congression errors and a decreased sensitivity to mitotic arrest by Eg5 inhibitors.	1
A second possibility is that the kinase domain of HER2 may have the ability to discriminate among autophosphorylation sites, leading to distinctive autophosphorylation.	2
We show that TAS-116 induced synergistic anti-myeloma cytotoxicity and enhanced dabrafenib-induced apoptosis in rat sarcoma-mutated myeloma cell lines.	1
"Using western blot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, we observed that WT PRL-3 was phosphorylated on tyrosine in the presence of Src, whereas a mutant form of PRL-3 lacking all six tyrosines (designated ""All_F"") was not ( )."	1
It has been reported that the expression of IER3 mRNA starts within 10 minutes after EGF stimulation , but it is not known exactly how long it takes for IER3 protein expression to begin.	1
We can hypothesize that the threonine 198A/G substitution results in an unstable conformation of the C-terminal tail of p27, which is then more rapidly recognized and degraded via the unfolded protein degradation system.	3
Taken together, these results suggest that the combination of TAS-116 and dabrafenib has a synergistic anti-myeloma effect, even in BRAF-mutated myeloma cells.	2
However, considering the prominence of nuclear Net1 and the fact that a biological stimulus that promotes Net1 translocation out the nucleus to the cytosol has yet to be discovered, we hypothesized that Net1 might have a previously unidentified function in the nucleus of cells.	3
Despite evidence that overexpression of oncogenic Ras can repress CD24 surface expression (Morel et al., ) the mechanism for this regulation of CD24 is not known.	2
It has been shown that recruitment of inflammatory cells to tumor sites by interaction of chemokines with chemokine receptors favors metastasis ( ).	1
Further investigation of the mechanism of PKA-mediated Shp2 inhibition demonstrated that the T73A/S189A mutations do not significantly alter Shp2 SH2 binding to phosphorylated Grb2-associtated binding protein 1, Grb2-associated binding protein 2, and protein kinase D1.	1
Considering the involvement of Gab2 in breast cancer and melanoma, we hypothesize that Gab2 expression contributes to the progression of ovarian cancer.	3
The results showed that after 48-h treatment, PF-3758309 could significantly reduce the p-PAK4 levels in AGS/CDDP and MKN-45/CDDP cells in a dose-dependent manner ( A).	3
The results showed that the MSK1 and NF-κB p65 indeed interact and that Orf virus-encoded protein 002 and the intact N-terminus of Orf virus-encoded protein 002 (002GM3 and 002GM4) interfere with the interaction between NF-κB p65 and MSK1 ( , lane 4 and B lane 1, 4 and 5).	1
However, we show here that the catalytically inactive SHP2 mutant attenuates oncogenic Ras activation, which questions the involvement of Sprouty in SHP2-mediated regulation of Ras.	1
However, it was also reported that B56γ1 inhibited locomotion through dephosphorylation of paxillin or mdm2 , . p53 protein was also reported to be a substrate of PP2A-B56γ1 and -B56γ3 , .	1
We demonstrate that the enhanced differentiation might be associated with the RARα/STAT1 axis activation rather than HER2 inhibition.	1
It is possible that ERK is coupled to linker for activation of T cells by virtue of Grb2 recruiting the activator small G-proteins, but as is true in T cells, additional Ras GEFs such as RasGRP may be involved ( - ).	2
This suggests that Src may regulate the invasion- and metastasis-associated functions of PRL-3 through phosphorylation.	2
However, because we used cadherin mutants that did not associate with p120, we did not address the possibility that in the context of the cadherin complex, p120 might also negatively affect adhesion.	3
However, while stable expression of LKB1 in T-Rex™ HeLa cells increased the basal activity of the endogenous ARKs SIK1, SIK2, SIK3, NUAK2, MARK1, MARK2/MARK3 and MARK4, unlike AMPK none was significantly activated by A23187 in the parental cells ( ) (for these experiments, MARK2 and MARK3 were assayed together because we do not have an antibody that distinguishes between these two closely related kinases [ ]).	3
Consistent with distinct phenotype of pathological angiogenesis there is a growing number of mouse models in which tumor-mediated angiogenesis is defective while embryonic angiogenesis is not ( ; ; ), suggesting that perhaps c-Cbl selectively plays role in pathological angiogenesis.	2
It is possible that the N-terminus of Orf virus-encoded protein 002 affects NF-κB p65 (Lys310) acetylation through blocking phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 (Ser276) and preventing nuclear factors κB-dependent transcriptional activation.	2
By comparing the morphology of the cell models described above under a light microscope, we found that elevated expression of Gab2 in SW480 cells induced the conversion of polarized epithelial cells to spindle-shaped, fibroblast-like mesenchymal cells with decreased cell-cell contact.	1
However, other studies have shown that pharmacological inhibition of p38 both in vitro and in vivo prevented toxicity [ - ].	1
These results demonstrate that BMP9 inhibits the activation of ERK1/2 and AKT.	1
